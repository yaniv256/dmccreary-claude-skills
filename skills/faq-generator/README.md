# FAQ Generator Skill

Automatically generate comprehensive, categorized FAQs for intelligent textbooks with Bloom's Taxonomy distribution and chatbot integration.

## Overview

This skill converts textbook content (chapters, glossary, learning graphs) into well-organized Frequently Asked Questions. Questions are distributed across Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive levels, categorized by learning progression, and exported as chatbot-ready JSON for RAG system integration.

## Installation

To use this skill with Claude Code or Claude.ai:

1. Install the skill by providing the path to this directory
2. The skill will be available for Claude to use when generating FAQs

## Usage

**Trigger Phrases:**

- "Generate an FAQ for my textbook"
- "Create frequently asked questions"
- "Build an FAQ from my course content"

**Prerequisites:**

## Quality Standards

### Content Completeness Score (1-100)

Assesses whether sufficient content exists for quality FAQ:

- **90-100:** All inputs present, high quality
- **70-89:** Core inputs present, some gaps
- **50-69:** Limited content, basic FAQ possible
- **Below 50:** Insufficient content, user dialog triggered

### Overall FAQ Quality Score (1-100)

Four components:

1. **Coverage (30 pts):** % of concepts addressed
   - 80%+ concepts = 30 pts
   - 60-79% = 20 pts
   - <60% = 10 pts

2. **Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution (25 pts):**
   - Target: 20% Remember, 30% Understand, 25% Apply, 15% Analyze, 7% Evaluate, 3% Create
   - Scored by deviation from target (±10% acceptable)

3. **Answer Quality (25 pts):**
   - Examples: 40%+ with examples
   - Links: 60%+ with source links
   - Length: 100-300 words average
   - Completeness: 100% fully answered

4. **Organization (20 pts):**
   - Logical categorization
   - Progressive difficulty
   - No duplicates
   - Clear, searchable phrasing

# Intelligent Textbooks FAQ

## Getting Started

## What is this course about?

This course teaches you how to build intelligent textbooks using
open source tools like MkDocs and AI-powered content generation.
You'll learn to create interactive educational resources that adapt
to student needs through learning graphs, MicroSims, and automated
quality assessment.

**See:** [Course Description](course-description.md)

## Core Concepts

## What is a Learning Graph?

A Learning Graph is a directed graph of concepts that reflects the
order concepts should be learned to master a new concept. It maps
prerequisite relationships as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),
ensuring students learn foundational concepts before advanced ones.

**Example:** In a programming course, the learning graph shows
"Variables" must be understood before "Functions," which must be
understood before "Recursion."

**See:** [Learning Graph Concept](concepts/learning-graph.md),
[Glossary](glossary.md)

### Bloom's Taxonomy Guide

The skill uses the canonical Bloom's Taxonomy reference at `$HOME/.claude/skills/chapter-content-generator/references/blooms-taxonomy.md`. This reference covers:

- Detailed descriptions of all 6 cognitive levels
- Question starters and cognitive actions for each level
- Target distributions by category
- Question writing guidelines
- Common mistakes and corrections
- Quality checklist

Claude will reference this document when determining appropriate Bloom's levels for questions.

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Ensure prerequisites exist** - Generate learning graph and glossary first
2. **Write substantial content** - 5,000+ words recommended for quality FAQ
3. **Review quality report** - Use recommendations to improve coverage
4. **Iterate as needed** - Add questions for uncovered concepts
5. **Integrate with chatbot** - Use JSON export for AI assistant training

### For FAQ Generation

1. **Balance Bloom's levels** - Don't over-focus on Remember/Understand
2. **Include examples** - 40%+ of answers should have concrete examples
3. **Link to sources** - Link to chapter files only; never use anchor fragments
4. **Use clear phrasing** - Make questions searchable and specific
5. **Avoid duplicates** - Check for similar questions across categories
6. **Match audience level** - Adjust complexity to target audience

## Troubleshooting

### "Content completeness score is low (<60)"

**Cause:** Insufficient content for quality FAQ generation

**Solution:**
- Write more chapter content (target: 10,000+ words)
- Ensure glossary has 50+ terms
- Complete learning graph with dependencies
- Finalize course description with learning outcomes

### "Bloom's distribution is imbalanced"

**Cause:** Too many questions at lower cognitive levels

**Solution:**
- Add more Apply/Analyze questions (scenarios, relationships)
- Include Evaluate questions (trade-offs, recommendations)
- Add a few Create questions (designs, innovations)
- Review Bloom's guide for question templates

### "Low concept coverage (<60%)"

**Cause:** Many learning graph concepts not addressed in FAQ

**Solution:**
- Review coverage gaps report
- Add questions for high-centrality concepts first
- Focus on core concepts category
- Consider if some concepts are too granular

### "Missing examples or links"

**Cause:** Answers lack concrete illustrations or references

**Solution:**
- Add examples to abstract or complex concepts
- Link answers to relevant chapter files
- Never use anchor fragments; file-only links remain valid when section headings change
- Ensure examples are from course domain
