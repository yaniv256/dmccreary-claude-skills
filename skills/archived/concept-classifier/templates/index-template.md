## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

By completing this quiz, students will be able to:

1. **Identify** the key characteristics of each category
2. **Distinguish** between similar categories
3. **Explain** why specific examples belong to particular categories
4. **Apply** classification skills to analyze new scenarios

### Bloom's Taxonomy Level

This activity primarily addresses **Application (Level 3)** - students must apply their knowledge of categories to analyze new scenarios they haven't seen before.

### Pre-Quiz Discussion (5 minutes)

Before starting the quiz, discuss:

- What are the main categories we'll be identifying?
- What key characteristics define each category?
- Why is it important to recognize these categories?

### Quiz Activity (15-20 minutes)

1. Have students complete the quiz individually
2. Encourage them to use the "Show Hint" feature only after careful consideration
3. Ask them to read each explanation carefully after answering

### Post-Quiz Reflection (10 minutes)

Discussion questions:

1. Which category was hardest to identify? Why?
2. What patterns did you notice that helped you classify correctly?
3. How might you apply this classification skill in real situations?
4. What strategies helped you distinguish between similar categories?

### Extension Activity

Have students find or create their own examples for each category and explain their reasoning.
