# Cover Image Generator

This guide's primary job is to produce the best possible cover image **prompt** at
`docs/img/cover-image-prompt.md` — one written from the textbook's actual content so
a text-to-image model has everything it needs to produce a professional, on-topic
cover on the first or second try.

**Generating the image itself is optional and must be explicitly requested by the
user.** Most users want to take the finished prompt, paste it into a text-to-image
tool of their choice (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Gemini, Leonardo.ai, Ideogram, etc.),
review a few draft covers, and iterate on the *prompt* — not the API call — before
anything is treated as final. Do not run `generate-cover.sh` or call any image
generation API unless the user asks for it by name (e.g., "auto-generate the
cover," "run the cover script," "call the API").

## Why the Prompt Is the Deliverable

The cover image is often the first thing a prospective reader sees — on the repo
page, in a social media unfurl, in a search result. A strong prompt, refined
against the book's real content, is what separates a generic stock-art cover from
one that actually represents the textbook. Because text-to-image results are
non-deterministic, users typically want to see 2-4 draft renders from their
preferred tool before spending API credits or committing to a final asset. This
guide optimizes for that human-in-the-loop review step, not for full automation.

## What Gets Produced

1. **Always**: a detailed cover image prompt at `docs/img/cover-image-prompt.md`,
   built from the book's title, course description, concept list, and (if present)
   mascot and MicroSim screenshots.
2. **Only if explicitly requested**: the rendered `docs/img/cover.png`, produced by
   running `generate-cover.sh` (API, browser automation, or local-prompt path — see
   [Optional: Auto-Generating the Image](#optional-auto-generating-the-image)).

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. **Project Structure**: An MkDocs project with:
   - `mkdocs.yml` containing a `site_name:` field for the book title
   - `docs/course-description.md` with book content description
   - `docs/img/` directory (will be created if missing)
   - `docs/img/mascot/` directory with book mascot images (optional)
   - `docs/img/mascot/welcome.png` welcome mascot image (optional)
   - `docs/learning-graph/concept-list.md` or `learning-graph.json` (optional, improves montage quality)
   - `docs/sims/*/*.png` MicroSim screenshots (optional, improves montage quality)

2. **Only needed if the user requests auto-generation**: the `generate-cover.sh`
   script at:
   ```
   ~/.claude/skills/claude-skills/src/image-generation/generate-cover.sh
   ```
   Or the full path to the claude-skills repository.

## Workflow: Generating the Prompt

### Step 1: Verify Required Project Files

```bash
# Check for mkdocs.yml
ls mkdocs.yml

# Check for course description
ls docs/course-description.md

# Check/create output directory
mkdir -p docs/img
```

If `docs/course-description.md` is missing, tell the user to create it first —
it's the primary source of subject-matter keywords for the prompt.

### Step 2: Gather Source Material

Collect everything that will make the prompt specific to *this* book, not a
generic textbook:

- **Title**: read `site_name` from `mkdocs.yml`.
- **Subject matter & tone**: read `docs/course-description.md` for topic, audience,
  and any stated visual/branding preferences.
- **Montage concepts**: read `docs/learning-graph/concept-list.md` (or derive from
  `docs/learning-graph/learning-graph.json`) for the concept vocabulary of the book.
- **MicroSim screenshots**: glob `docs/sims/*/*.png` — these are strong montage
  candidates because they're real artifacts from the book, not generic stock
  imagery.
- **Mascot**: check for `docs/img/mascot/welcome.png`.

```bash
ls docs/img/mascot/welcome.png 2>/dev/null
ls docs/sims/*/*.png 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Select the Montage Concepts

Choose **6-10 concepts** for the background montage using these criteria, in
priority order:

1. **Recognizable or evocative** — a reader with some familiarity with the subject
   should recognize it, or it should be visually interesting enough to draw in a
   reader with none.
2. **Spread across the book**, not clustered in one chapter — pick concepts that
   signal the book's overall scope.
3. **Prefer real MicroSim screenshots** over invented illustrations when a good
   one exists — it's authentic to the book and free.
4. **Visually distinct from each other** — avoid picking 6 concepts that would all
   render as "person looking at a screen."
5. Text is acceptable inside a montage image only if it will render legibly at
   small size (a formula, a short label, an axis) — avoid concepts that require
   paragraphs of readable text.

List the chosen concepts with a one-line visual description each (not just the
concept label) so the text-to-image model has something concrete to draw, e.g.
`Neural Network — a glowing layered node-and-edge diagram, blue on dark
background` rather than just `Neural Network`.

### Step 4: Write the Prompt File

Generate `docs/img/cover-image-prompt.md` using the template below. Fill in every
bracketed field — an unfilled placeholder is worse than an omitted section.

```markdown
# Cover Image Prompt

Please generate a professional-quality cover image for this textbook.
This image will be used in social media previews and must follow the
formatting guidelines for an Open Graph image preview.

**Required specifications:**
- Format: PNG
- Wide-landscape format
- Size: 1200x630 pixels (1.91:1 aspect ratio)
- This is the Open Graph standard for social media previews

The image has four layers, back to front: background montage, color
treatment, mascot, and title text.

## Subject & Tone

{BOOK_TITLE} is a textbook about {ONE_SENTENCE_SUBJECT_SUMMARY, drawn from
course-description.md}. The intended audience is {AUDIENCE}. The visual tone
should be {e.g. "modern and technical," "warm and approachable," "scientific
and precise"} — pick a tone that matches the subject, not a default.

## Title

Place {BOOK_TITLE} in the center of the image, in a clean, highly legible
sans-serif font. Use a light/white font color with a subtle drop shadow or
dark scrim behind it so it stays readable against the busy montage
background. Keep the title short enough to render at a large size — do not
shrink it to fit if the title is long; instead simplify the background
directly behind the text.

## Background Montage

Arrange a montage of the following {N} concepts around the title, each
rendered in a consistent illustration style (see Style below) so the
composition reads as one image rather than a collage of unrelated styles:

{MONTAGE_IMAGE_LIST — one line per concept: name + concrete visual description}

## Mascot

{IF MASCOT PRESENT:}
Place the book's mascot in the lower-left corner, sized so it does not
overlap the title text. The mascot is described as: {MASCOT_DESCRIPTION, or
"see attached reference image"}.
{IF NO MASCOT:}
(No mascot for this book — omit this element entirely.)

## Style & Composition

- Illustration style: {e.g. "flat vector," "digital painting," "isometric
  technical illustration"} — choose one style and apply it to every montage
  element for visual consistency.
- Color palette: {2-3 dominant colors drawn from the subject matter, e.g.
  "deep blue and teal with amber accents"}.
- Lighting/mood: {e.g. "bright and optimistic," "moody and dramatic"}.
- Composition: title centered, montage elements arranged in a loose ring or
  grid around it, mascot (if any) in the lower-left, generous negative space
  immediately behind the title so it stays readable.

## Avoid

- Do not render dense paragraphs of illegible text anywhere in the image.
- Avoid generic stock-photo cliches (handshakes, isolated lightbulbs, people
  pointing at whiteboards) unless one is explicitly one of the chosen concepts.
- Avoid photorealistic human faces unless the book's subject calls for a
  specific recognizable figure.
- Do not let montage elements visually compete with or overlap the title.
```

### Step 5: Present the Prompt for Review

After writing the file, tell the user the prompt is ready at
`docs/img/cover-image-prompt.md` and recommend the manual review loop:

1. Open the prompt file and copy its contents.
2. Paste it into a text-to-image tool (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Gemini, Leonardo.ai,
   Ideogram, or any preferred tool).
3. Generate 2-4 draft covers and compare them.
4. If a draft misses the mark — wrong tone, unreadable title, mascot placement
   off — refine the *prompt* (montage list, style, color palette) rather than
   just re-rolling, and regenerate the draft.
5. Once a draft looks right, save it as `docs/img/cover.png` (resize to
   1200x630 if needed).

Do not proceed to image generation yourself at this point — wait for the user
to either do this manually or explicitly ask you to automate it.

## Optional: Auto-Generating the Image

Only do this if the user explicitly asks to auto-generate, run the script, or
call the API. If they haven't, stop after Step 5 above.

### Determine the User's API Resources

Ask the user these questions to determine the best workflow:

**Question 1: OpenAI API Key**
```
Do you have an OpenAI API key set up?
(Check with: echo $OPENAI_API_KEY)

1. Yes, I have an API key with active billing
2. Yes, I have an API key but billing is not active
3. No, I don't have an API key
```

**Question 2: ChatGPT Subscription (if no active API billing)**
```
Do you have a ChatGPT Pro/Plus subscription ($20/month)?

1. Yes
2. No
```

**Question 3: Operating System (if has ChatGPT Pro)**
```
Are you running on macOS?

1. Yes (can use browser automation)
2. No (will use manual copy/paste)
```

### Select and Run the Appropriate Command

Based on the answers, use one of these workflows:

#### Path A: Full Auto Mode (API key + active billing)

This is the fastest, fully automated option.

```bash
# Navigate to the user's project root
cd /path/to/project

# Run the script with no flags
~/.claude/skills/claude-skills/src/image-generation/generate-cover.sh
```

The script will:
1. Extract book title from mkdocs.yml
2. Generate an optimized image prompt
3. Call OpenAI Images API
4. Save the result to `docs/img/cover.png`

**Expected output:**
```
=== Cover Image Generator ===
Project directory: /path/to/project
Book Title: Your Book Title
...
Generating cover image...
Wrote: docs/img/cover.png
```

#### Path B: Browser Automation (ChatGPT Pro + macOS)

For users with ChatGPT Pro on macOS.

```bash
# Navigate to the user's project root
cd /path/to/project

# Run with --open-browser flag
~/.claude/skills/claude-skills/src/image-generation/generate-cover.sh --open-browser
```

The script will:
1. Extract book title from mkdocs.yml
2. Generate an optimized image prompt locally (no API call)
3. Open ChatGPT in the default browser
4. Automatically paste the prompt

**Note:** First run may require granting Accessibility permissions:
- System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
- Allow Terminal (or your terminal app) to control the computer

**After the script runs:**
1. Wait for ChatGPT to generate the image
2. Download the generated image
3. Save it to `docs/img/cover.png`
4. Resize to 1200x630 pixels if needed

#### Path C: Local Prompt (ChatGPT Pro, any OS)

For users with ChatGPT Pro on non-macOS systems.

```bash
# Navigate to the user's project root
cd /path/to/project

# Run with --local-prompt flag
~/.claude/skills/claude-skills/src/image-generation/generate-cover.sh --local-prompt
```

The script will:
1. Extract book title from mkdocs.yml
2. Generate an optimized image prompt locally (no API call)
3. Display the prompt for manual copying

**After the script runs:**
1. Copy the displayed IMAGE PROMPT
2. Go to https://chatgpt.com/
3. Paste the prompt
4. Download the generated image
5. Save it to `docs/img/cover.png`
6. Resize to 1200x630 pixels if needed

#### Path D: No Resources Available

If the user has neither API billing nor ChatGPT Pro:

**Option 1: Set up OpenAI API billing**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Add a payment method
3. Add credits ($5-10 is sufficient for many images)
4. Return and use Path A

**Option 2: Subscribe to ChatGPT Pro**
1. Go to https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing
2. Subscribe to Plus ($20/month)
3. Return and use Path B or C

**Option 3: Use the prompt manually with a free tier**
1. Use the prompt already written to `docs/img/cover-image-prompt.md`
2. Use it with any free AI image generator:
   - Bing Image Creator (free)
   - Leonardo.ai (free tier)
   - Ideogram (free tier)

### Verify the Cover Image

After generation, verify the image:

```bash
# Check file exists
ls -la docs/img/cover.png

# Check dimensions (if ImageMagick installed)
identify docs/img/cover.png
```

## Update the Home Page (Optional)

If the user wants to display the cover on their home page, add to `docs/index.md`:

```markdown
---
title: Your Book Title
description: Brief description
image: /img/cover.png
og:image: /img/cover.png
---

![Your Book Title](./img/cover.png){ width="100%" }
```

## Troubleshooting

The following issues only apply if the user has opted into auto-generation
via `generate-cover.sh`.

### "billing_not_active" Error

Your OpenAI API key is valid but the account lacks billing.

**Solutions:**
- Add payment method at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- Or use `--local-prompt` with ChatGPT Pro

### "Could not extract site_name from mkdocs.yml"

The `mkdocs.yml` file is missing the `site_name:` field.

**Fix:**
```yaml
# Add to mkdocs.yml
site_name: Your Book Title
```

### "Course description not found"

The file `docs/course-description.md` doesn't exist.

**Fix:**
Create the file with a description of your book's content, topics, and themes. This provides keywords for the image generation.

### Auto-paste not working on macOS

First run requires Accessibility permissions.

**Fix:**
1. Open System Settings
2. Go to Privacy & Security > Accessibility
3. Enable your terminal app (Terminal, iTerm2, etc.)
4. Run the script again

### Image is wrong dimensions

Text-to-image tools may not generate exact dimensions.

**Fix:**
1. Open the image in an editor (Preview on macOS, GIMP, etc.)
2. Resize to 1200x630 pixels
3. Save as PNG
