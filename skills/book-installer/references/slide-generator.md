# Install Slide Generator

## Overview

This guide does two things:

1. **Installs the slide-viewer MicroSim** into `docs/sims/slide-viewer/` by copying four template files. The viewer fetches any rendered MkDocs page URL, splits the page's content on `<hr>` elements, and renders each chunk as a slide.
2. **Generates a `slides.md` deck** for each chapter the user specifies, distilling the chapter's `index.md` into a presentation with a title slide, content slides separated by `---`, and a closing celebration slide.

Total install time: under 2 minutes for the viewer. Generating slides for a chapter typically takes one pass per chapter (the content summarization is an LLM task, not a script).

## Viewer Version

Current template version: **v0.01**.

When you ship a behavior change to the viewer templates, bump the version in **three** places:

1. The version in this file (the line above).
2. `references/assets/slide-viewer/main.html` — the `<div id="viewer-version">v0.01</div>` line.
3. The changelog entry below.

### Changelog

- **v0.01** — Initial template. Fetches rendered MkDocs HTML, splits on `<hr>`, keyboard + button navigation, first/last jumps, fullscreen, table of contents, mascot in lower-left corner (neutral on every slide, celebration on the last).

## Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

```bash
ls mkdocs.yml docs/chapters/ 2>&1
```

If either is missing, the project isn't a MkDocs Material textbook yet — run the `mkdocs-template.md` guide first.

Optional but recommended — if the project has a mascot installed, the viewer will use `neutral.png` and `celebration.png` automatically:

```bash
ls docs/img/mascot/neutral.png docs/img/mascot/celebration.png 2>&1
```

Missing mascot images are harmless: the viewer still works, the mascot img just 404s silently.

## Step 2: Install the Slide Viewer

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$HOME/.claude/skills/book-installer/references/assets/slide-viewer"
mkdir -p docs/sims/slide-viewer
cp "$SKILL_DIR/main.html"  docs/sims/slide-viewer/main.html
cp "$SKILL_DIR/script.js"  docs/sims/slide-viewer/script.js
cp "$SKILL_DIR/local.css"  docs/sims/slide-viewer/local.css
cp "$SKILL_DIR/index.md"   docs/sims/slide-viewer/index.md
```

### File Structure Installed

```
docs/sims/slide-viewer/
├── main.html   # Viewer shell with controls and mascot slot
├── script.js   # Fetches rendered HTML, splits on <hr>, handles nav
├── local.css   # 16:9 slide stage, mascot positioning, responsive
└── index.md    # MkDocs page — describes the viewer, lists deck links
```

## Step 3: Add the Viewer to mkdocs.yml

Add this entry under the existing MicroSims section in `mkdocs.yml` (create the section if it doesn't exist):

```yaml
nav:
  # ... existing nav ...
  - MicroSims:
    - Slide Viewer: sims/slide-viewer/index.md
```

## Step 4: Confirm Which Chapters to Generate Slides For

**Ask the user which chapters** to generate slides for. Accept any of:

- A list of chapter numbers: "1, 2, 5"
- A range: "chapters 1 through 4"
- "all" — every chapter directory under `docs/chapters/`

List available chapters first so the user can pick:

```bash
ls docs/chapters/ | grep -v '^index'
```

**Do not generate slides for chapters whose `index.md` does not yet have content.** A chapter that is only a title and summary produces a thin, low-value deck. Check with:

```bash
for d in docs/chapters/*/; do
  lines=$(wc -l < "$d/index.md")
  echo "$lines $d"
done
```

Skip chapters under ~100 lines unless the user insists.

## Step 5: Generate slides.md for Each Selected Chapter

For each selected chapter, create `docs/chapters/<chapter-slug>/slides.md` by summarizing the chapter's `index.md`. This is a **writing task, not a script** — the LLM reads the chapter and drafts the deck.

### Deck Structure (required)

Every generated deck must follow this shape:

1. **Navigation button bar** (before any slide content):

   ```markdown
   [Content](../){ .md-button } [Slides in Viewer](../../../sims/slide-viewer/main.html?src=../../chapters/<chapter-slug>/slides/){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
   ```

   **Path-depth note.** MkDocs serves `slides.md` at `/chapters/<chapter-slug>/slides/`, so:
   - `../` from the rendered slides page lands on the chapter index (`/chapters/<chapter-slug>/`).
   - `../../../` climbs to the site root, where `sims/slide-viewer/main.html` lives.
   - The `src=` parameter is resolved by the viewer's own JavaScript relative to `/sims/slide-viewer/`, which is why that portion stays `../../chapters/<chapter-slug>/slides/`.

   Using `./` for the Content link is a common mistake — `./` resolves to the same slides page, not the chapter.

2. **Title slide** — `# Chapter Title`, one-line subtitle, short tagline or the mascot's catchphrase, author/mascot attribution line. Keep it to 4–6 lines of text.

3. **Content slides**, separated by `---` on its own line. Each slide should:
   - Start with an `## H2` heading that names the idea.
   - Hold 3–7 bullets OR one short paragraph OR one small table — **not all three**.
   - Keep prose spoken-voice, not paragraph-dense. A slide is a signpost; the speaker fills in detail.
   - Use `>` blockquotes for emphasis/quotations, sparingly.

4. **Retrieval check slide** — if the chapter has a retrieval section, preserve 3–5 of its questions on one slide. Mark Bloom levels in parentheses where the source does.

5. **Bridge slide** — one slide that names what the next chapter sets up.

6. **Celebration slide** (always the last slide) — a short, affirming close. The viewer swaps the mascot pose to `celebration.png` on this slide automatically; don't try to embed an image yourself.

### Slide Count Guidance

- Short/framework chapters (~200 lines of `index.md`): aim for **15–20 slides**.
- Deep content chapters (~300+ lines): aim for **22–28 slides**.
- Hard ceiling: **30 slides**. If you exceed that, you're paragraphing the chapter onto slides instead of distilling it.

### Voice and Style Rules

Follow the project's CLAUDE.md style guide if one exists. For Learning Sciences and similar projects, these rules apply to slides too:

- No "obviously", "simply", "just", "clearly".
- No hype adjectives ("game-changing", "revolutionary").
- Term-of-art in **bold** on first use on a slide.
- Present tense, active voice, contractions welcome.
- If the chapter has a mascot voice (like Bloom), the title and celebration slides can carry the mascot's signature line — but body slides stay in chapter prose voice.

### What to Leave Out

- **Skip long tables** that won't fit at a glance. If a table is 7+ rows, compress to the 3–4 rows that matter most.
- **Skip embedded diagrams** (Mermaid, MicroSim blocks, collapsible `<details>` spec blocks). The viewer renders plain HTML from MkDocs; complex interactive blocks will not render as intended. Replace each with a **one-slide textual summary** of what the diagram shows and what the reader takes away.
- **Skip admonitions** (`!!! mascot-*`, `!!! info`, etc.). The mascot slot in the viewer already carries the mascot. Admonition styling is heavy for a slide.

### Required Cross-Links on the Chapter's index.md

After generating `slides.md`, update the chapter's `index.md` to add a button bar at the very top, right after the `# Chapter Title` line. **Do not include a "Content" button on the chapter page itself — the reader is already on the content, so that button would be redundant.**

```markdown
# <Chapter Title>

[Slides](slides/){ .md-button } [Slides in Viewer](../../sims/slide-viewer/main.html?src=../../chapters/<chapter-slug>/slides/){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
```

From the rendered `slides.md` page, readers already see a **Content** button (added in the deck template above) that links back to the chapter. The two pages cross-link each other; neither page shows a button to itself.

## Step 6: Update mkdocs.yml Nav for Each Deck

For every chapter that got a `slides.md`, restructure its nav entry from a single link into a `Content`/`Slides` subsection:

```yaml
# Before:
- 1. Chapter Title: chapters/01-slug/index.md

# After:
- 1. Chapter Title:
    - Content: chapters/01-slug/index.md
    - Slides: chapters/01-slug/slides.md
```

Leave chapters without decks as single-link entries.

## Step 7: Update the Slide Viewer's Deck List

The viewer's `index.md` contains an HTML-comment placeholder:

```markdown
<!-- DECK_LIST_START -->
<!-- Deck links are appended here by the slide-generator installer. -->
<!-- DECK_LIST_END -->
```

Replace the inner comment with one line per chapter deck generated:

```markdown
<!-- DECK_LIST_START -->
- [Chapter 1 — <Chapter Title>](main.html?src=../../chapters/01-slug/slides/){target=_blank}
- [Chapter 2 — <Chapter Title>](main.html?src=../../chapters/02-slug/slides/){target=_blank}
<!-- DECK_LIST_END -->
```

When adding a new chapter later, append a line inside the markers; don't recreate the list.

## Step 8: Verify

Tell the user to reload the browser tab running `mkdocs serve` (the user runs this themselves — never start or kill `mkdocs serve` yourself) and test:

1. **Viewer page:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/<repo-name>/sims/slide-viewer/` — deck links should appear.
2. **Chapter page:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/<repo-name>/chapters/01-<slug>/` — three-button bar at the top.
3. **Slides page (rendered):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/<repo-name>/chapters/01-<slug>/slides/` — slides stacked with horizontal rules.
4. **Slides in the viewer:** click **Slides in Viewer** — first slide is the title, arrow keys advance, last slide shows the celebration mascot.

If the viewer shows "Could not load slides from ... HTTP 404": the `src=` query is pointing at a `.md` file. MkDocs does not serve raw `.md`. The `src` must end in `/` (a directory-style URL), not `.md`.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Viewer shows "Could not load slides ... HTTP 404" | `src=` points at a `.md` file | Use the rendered URL: end in `/`, not `.md` |
| Only one slide shows; everything is on it | Source `slides.md` has no `---` horizontal rules | Separator must be `---` on its own line, with blank lines above and below |
| Mascot does not appear | `docs/img/mascot/neutral.png` not installed | Install the mascot via `learning-mascot.md`, or ignore — viewer still works |
| Deck nav buttons break the title slide | Buttons placed after the first `---` | The button bar must be at the very top of `slides.md`, before any slide separator |
| "Content" button on `slides.md` stays on the same page | Link uses `./` (current directory = same slides page) | Use `../` to reach the chapter index — `slides.md` renders at `/chapters/<slug>/slides/`, so `../` lands on `/chapters/<slug>/` |
| "Slides in Viewer" button on `slides.md` 404s | Only two `../` when three are needed | From `/chapters/<slug>/slides/` the site root is three levels up. Use `../../../sims/slide-viewer/main.html?src=...` |
| Slides in viewer look ugly (raw admonitions, collapsed `<details>`) | Chapter content was copied verbatim instead of distilled | Re-summarize: slides are 3–7 bullets, not full chapter prose |

## Dependencies

- MkDocs Material (the viewer assumes the theme's `article.md-content__inner` container).
- Optional: `docs/img/mascot/neutral.png` and `docs/img/mascot/celebration.png` from the `learning-mascot.md` guide.
- No runtime JS dependencies (marked.js is **not** used — MkDocs already renders the markdown; the viewer walks the DOM).

## Why the Viewer Fetches Rendered HTML (Not Raw `.md`)

MkDocs does not serve raw `.md` files. A file at `docs/chapters/01-foundations/slides.md` becomes a rendered HTML page at `/chapters/01-foundations/slides/`. Fetching the raw `.md` path returns 404. The viewer therefore:

1. Strips any trailing `.md` or `/index.md` from the `src` parameter.
2. Appends `/` if missing.
3. Fetches the rendered page, extracts `article.md-content__inner`, and splits children on `<hr>` elements.

This is why horizontal rules (`---`) are the slide separator — they survive intact as `<hr>` in the rendered HTML.
