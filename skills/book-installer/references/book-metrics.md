# Book Metrics

Generate comprehensive quantitative metrics for an intelligent textbook:
content volume, educational components, and interactive elements. Use this to
track progress, prepare status reports, assess completeness before publication,
or estimate the printed-page equivalent of the digital book.

## What It Produces

Running the metrics tool writes/updates four files in `docs/learning-graph/`:

1. **`book-metrics.md`** — overall book statistics (Book Composition table +
   Student-Facing Content Metrics table).
2. **`chapter-metrics.md`** — per-chapter breakdown (sections, diagrams,
   equations, words, links, quiz questions, references).
3. **`book-metrics.json`** — the **canonical, machine-readable** book-wide
   totals and the **single source of truth** for every skill that needs the
   numbers (see [Book Metrics JSON](#book-metrics-json) below). Fully owned by
   the script and overwritten each run; validated by `book-metrics.schema.json`.
4. **`book-metadata.json`** — author-supplied descriptive fields (title,
   creator, license, cover image, repository, …) with a **mirrored** `metrics`
   block for backward compatibility (see [Book Metadata JSON](#book-metadata-json)).
   Created during learning-graph generation and **merged in place** here; author
   fields are preserved.

> **Which file should a skill read?** For any **count** (concepts, chapters,
> MicroSims, words, glossary terms, …) read **`book-metrics.json`**. For
> **identity** (title, author, repo URL, license, cover image) read
> `book-metadata.json` / `mkdocs.yml`. Never re-derive counts by parsing
> markdown or running `find | wc` — that is exactly the drift this file removes.

## Prerequisites

- A `docs/` directory with the textbook content.
- `docs/chapters/NN-*/index.md` chapter directories (numbered, each with an `index.md`).
- `$BK_HOME` exported (the user's profile sets it to the `claude-skills`
  checkout) and `bk-generate-book-metrics` on `$PATH` — the same convention used
  by `bk-diagram-reports`.

Optional inputs that enrich the metrics (each is counted only if present):

- `docs/learning-graph/learning-graph.csv` (concepts)
- `docs/glossary.md` (glossary terms), `docs/faq.md` (FAQs)
- `docs/sims/` (MicroSims), `docs/stories/` (stories)
- `docs/img/mascot/` (mascot poses), `docs/appendices/` (appendix pages)
- per-chapter `quiz.md` and `references.md`
- `mkdocs.yml` `extra.development_stage` (development stage)

## How to Run

```bash
# Primary — the wrapper resolves $BK_HOME/src/book-metrics/book-metrics.py
# Run from the project root (the directory containing docs/).
bk-generate-book-metrics

# Fallback if bk-generate-book-metrics is not on $PATH:
python3 "$BK_HOME/src/book-metrics/book-metrics.py" docs
```

The Python script is the single source of truth at
`src/book-metrics/book-metrics.py` in the `claude-skills` repo — do not copy it
elsewhere. If `bk-generate-book-metrics` reports "command not found", make sure
`~/.local/bin` is on `$PATH` (it symlinks the wrapper in
`claude-skills/scripts/`).

## Book Composition

`book-metrics.md` opens with a **Book Composition** table covering the twelve
tracked elements of an intelligent textbook, each labeled *Required*,
*Recommended*, or *Optional* (a required element that is still missing is
flagged with ⚠️):

| # | Element | Status | Source |
|---|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Concepts | Required | Rows in learning-graph.csv |
| 2 | Chapters | Required | Chapter directories with index.md |
| 3 | MicroSims | Recommended | Directories in docs/sims/ with index.md |
| 4 | Stories | Optional | Story directories in docs/stories/ with index.md |
| 5 | Chapter Quizzes | Recommended | Chapters with a quiz.md (plus total questions) |
| 6 | Chapter References | Recommended | Chapters with references.md (plus total references) |
| 7 | Glossary Terms | Recommended | H4 headers in glossary.md |
| 8 | FAQs | Recommended | H3 headers in faq.md |
| 9 | Words | Required | Words across student-facing markdown |
| 10 | Mascot | Optional | Image poses in docs/img/mascot/ |
| 11 | Appendices | Optional | Pages in appendices/ (excluding index.md) |
| 12 | Development Stage | Required | mkdocs.yml `extra.development_stage` or course-description.md |

## Student-Facing Content Metrics

A second table provides the deeper content counts, excluding administrative
directories (`prompts/`, `learning-graph/`):

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Diagrams | H4 headers starting with `#### Diagram:` |
| Equations | LaTeX expressions using `$` and `$$` delimiters |
| Total Words | All words in markdown (excluding code blocks and URLs) |
| Links | Markdown-formatted hyperlinks `[text](url)` |
| Equivalent Pages | Estimated pages from words + visuals |

**Page calculation formula:**

```
Pages = (Total Words ÷ 250) + (Diagrams × 0.25) + (MicroSims × 0.5)
```

Assumptions: 250 words per printed page, each diagram 0.25 page, each MicroSim
0.5 page.

## Book Metrics JSON

`docs/learning-graph/book-metrics.json` is the **canonical, machine-readable**
record of book-wide totals — the **single source of truth** that the
README generator, LinkedIn announcement generator, case-study generator, and
status reports all read. It is **fully owned by the script**: there are no
hand-edited fields, so every run overwrites it wholesale (no merge, no risk of
clobbering author content).

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmccreary/claude-skills/main/src/book-metrics/book-metrics.schema.json",
  "metricsVersion": "1.0",
  "metricsGeneratedBy": "Book Metrics Python Program v0.08",
  "metricsGeneratedOn": "June 03, 2026 at 10:13 AM",
  "metricsGeneratedOnISO": "2026-06-03T10:13:00",
  "metrics": {
    "concepts": 200,
    "chapters": 12,
    "microsims": 18,
    "stories": 2,
    "glossaryTerms": 200,
    "faqs": 40,
    "quizQuestions": 120,
    "chapterQuizzes": 12,
    "chapterReferences": 12,
    "references": 120,
    "diagrams": 30,
    "equations": 45,
    "words": 45000,
    "links": 300,
    "appendices": 3,
    "mascotImages": 7,
    "developmentStage": "Complete",
    "equivalentPages": 250
  }
}
```

These are the book-wide totals that feed the case-study cards in the
[intelligent-textbooks](https://github.com/dmccreary/intelligent-textbooks)
`docs/case-studies/index.md` page (e.g. "200 Concepts · 12 Chapters · 18
MicroSims · 45K Words · 200 Glossary Terms").

**Rules the script follows for `book-metrics.json`:**

- **Only book-wide totals** go in the `metrics` object. Per-chapter breakdowns
  are intentionally excluded — those live only in `chapter-metrics.md`.
- **Botany books** (those with a `docs/plants/` directory) additionally get
  `speciesCards`, `speciesCardsWithIllustration`, `speciesCardsWithPhotos`,
  and `speciesCardsWithQuickFacts` totals inside `metrics`.
- **Forward compatible:** new count metrics can be added without a format change
  — the schema requires any unrecognized `metrics` key to be a non-negative
  integer.

### JSON Schema and Validation

The format is defined by `src/book-metrics/book-metrics.schema.json`
(JSON Schema Draft 2020-12). Validate any file with:

```bash
python3 "$BK_HOME/src/book-metrics/validate-book-metrics.py" \
  docs/learning-graph/book-metrics.json
```

The validator uses the `jsonschema` package for full validation when it is
installed, and falls back to a dependency-free required-keys/type check
otherwise. Exit code `0` = valid, `1` = invalid, `2` = file/usage error.

### Consumer Contract (read, don't re-derive)

Any skill that needs book totals MUST read `book-metrics.json` rather than
counting markdown itself. Recommended pattern:

```bash
# Prefer the canonical file…
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, pathlib, sys
p = pathlib.Path("docs/learning-graph/book-metrics.json")
if not p.exists():
    sys.exit("book-metrics.json missing — run bk-generate-book-metrics first")
m = json.loads(p.read_text())["metrics"]
print(f"{m['concepts']} concepts · {m['chapters']} chapters · "
      f"{m['microsims']} MicroSims · {m['words']:,} words")
PY
```

If `book-metrics.json` is missing or stale, a consuming skill should run
`bk-generate-book-metrics` (or the `python3 "$BK_HOME/..."` fallback) to refresh
it, then read the result — never silently fall back to ad-hoc counting, which
reintroduces the drift this file exists to eliminate.

## Book Metadata JSON

`docs/learning-graph/book-metadata.json` holds the **author-supplied descriptive
fields** (title, description, creator, cover image, repository, license, etc.),
created when the learning graph is generated. For backward compatibility the
metrics run also **mirrors** the `metrics` block here — built from the *same*
payload as `book-metrics.json`, so the two can never drift:

```json
{
  "title": "My Intelligent Textbook",
  "description": "...",
  "creator": "Author Name",
  "metrics": { "... identical to book-metrics.json metrics ..." },
  "metricsGeneratedBy": "Book Metrics Python Program v0.08",
  "metricsGeneratedOn": "June 03, 2026 at 10:13 AM"
}
```

**Rules the script follows for `book-metadata.json`:**

- **Author fields are preserved.** Only the `metrics` block and the two
  `metricsGenerated*` fields are written; everything else is left untouched.
- **Safety:** if the existing `book-metadata.json` cannot be parsed as a JSON
  object, the script leaves it untouched and prints a warning rather than risk
  clobbering the author's metadata.
- **Migration note:** new consumers should read `book-metrics.json`. The
  mirrored block here exists only until existing readers (e.g. the
  intelligent-textbooks case-studies index) migrate to the canonical file.

## Add to Navigation

After generating, add the reports to `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
nav:
  - Learning Graph:
    - Book Metrics: learning-graph/book-metrics.md
    - Chapter Metrics: learning-graph/chapter-metrics.md
```

## Troubleshooting

- **No chapters found** — ensure chapter directories live in `docs/chapters/`,
  are named `NN-chapter-name/`, and each contains an `index.md`.
- **Concept count is zero** — verify `docs/learning-graph/learning-graph.csv`
  exists, is UTF-8, and has a header row plus data rows.
- **`bk-generate-book-metrics: command not found`** — confirm `~/.local/bin` is
  on `$PATH`; use the `python3 "$BK_HOME/src/book-metrics/book-metrics.py" docs`
  fallback otherwise.
- **`$BK_HOME` errors** — the wrapper requires `$BK_HOME` to point at the
  `claude-skills` checkout (e.g. `export BK_HOME=$HOME/Documents/ws/claude-skills`).
- **Word counts look off** — the script excludes code blocks and URLs; check for
  large code blocks or malformed markdown if numbers seem wrong.
