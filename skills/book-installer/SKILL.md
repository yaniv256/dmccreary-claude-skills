Type a number or feature name to install.

Note: If you see `navigation.tabs` in mkdocs.yml, remove it. These books
use side navigation optimized for wide landscape screens.
```

After displaying the list, wait for user to specify which feature they want.

---

## Step 1b: Check for Navigation Tabs (Existing Projects)

When working with an existing mkdocs.yml, always check for and remove navigation tabs:

```yaml
# REMOVE these lines if present in mkdocs.yml:
theme:
  features:
    - navigation.tabs        # DELETE
    - navigation.tabs.sticky # DELETE
```

These books use side navigation optimized for wide landscape screens. Top navigation tabs waste vertical space and are not appropriate for this format.

### social-media-preview.md

**Purpose:** Install a Cairo-free MkDocs hook that emits Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags on every page

**Creates:**
- `plugins/social_override.py` — `on_post_page` hook that injects/replaces `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:type`, `og:url`, and `twitter:*` tags
- `hooks:` block in `mkdocs.yml` referencing the new file

**Features:**
- Reads `image:`, `title:`, `description:` from each page's frontmatter; falls back to `img/cover.png` and the site-wide values
- Emits absolute `og:image` URLs by joining `site_url` with the image path (so crawlers and `bk-check-social-cover` can HEAD-request them)
- Works without `mkdocs-material[imaging]` / Cairo — the common-case default
- Compatible with the full `social` plugin when Cairo is present: replaces its auto-generated `/assets/images/social/...` URLs with the declared `cover.png`
- Verified via `~/.local/bin/bk-check-social-cover` (which enforces `og:image` basename = `cover.png` and image reachability)

**Prerequisites:**
- Existing MkDocs Material project with `site_url:` set
- `docs/img/cover.png` (use `cover-image-generator.md` or `home-page-template.md` first if missing)

- `docs/chapters/<slug>/slides.md` — per chapter: title slide, content slides separated by `---`, retrieval check, bridge, celebration close
- Three-button nav bar (`Content`, `Slides`, `Slides in Viewer`) at the top of each chapter's `index.md` and its `slides.md`
- mkdocs.yml nav restructured so each chapter with slides has `Content` / `Slides` sub-entries

**Features:**
- Viewer reads MkDocs' rendered HTML (never raw `.md` — MkDocs doesn't serve `.md` directly)
- Mascot integration: neutral pose on every slide, celebration pose on the last slide (uses `docs/img/mascot/neutral.png` and `celebration.png` if present; silently absent otherwise)
- First/last-slide jump buttons, `Home`/`End` keys, fullscreen, table-of-contents overlay
- Distills chapter `index.md` into 15–28 slides following project voice/style rules

**Routing:** Keywords "mascot chapter", "place mascot", "add mascot to chapter" → `references/mascot-chapter-updater.md`
**Action:** Read mascot-chapter-updater.md, survey the chapter, propose a placement plan with line numbers, wait for user confirmation, apply edits, run validate-chapter-mascots.py, and address any flags

### Example 15: Generate Favicon from Mascot
**User:** "generate favicon from mascot" or "create favicon.ico from neutral.png"
**Routing:** Keywords "generate favicon", "mascot favicon", "favicon from mascot" → `references/favicon-generator.md`
**Action:** Read favicon-generator.md, verify `docs/img/mascot/neutral.png` exists and Pillow is installed, run `scripts/generate-favicon.py` from the project root, then update `theme.favicon` in mkdocs.yml to `img/favicon.ico`

### Example 15b: Install Social Media Preview Hook
**User:** "add the social media preview mkdocs hook" or "my bk-check-social-cover is failing" or "install og:image meta tags"
**Routing:** Keywords "social media preview", "og:image", "bk-check-social-cover", "social hook" → `references/social-media-preview.md`
**Action:** Read social-media-preview.md, create `plugins/social_override.py` at the project root with the exact code in the reference, add a top-level `hooks: - plugins/social_override.py` block to `mkdocs.yml`, run `mkdocs build`, verify the nine og:* / twitter:* meta tags appear in `site/index.html`, then run `bk-check-social-cover` against either the deployed URL or a local server staging the build under `/<project>/`

### Example 17: Generate All Supplementary Content
**User:** "generate all supplementary content" or "complete the book" or "39"
**Routing:** Keywords "supplementary content", "complete the book", "39" → `references/supplementary-content-generator.md`
**Action:** Read supplementary-content-generator.md. First inventory existing files. Then execute Steps 2–12 in order: generate about page, landing page, README, glossary, FAQ, per-chapter quizzes and references, run `bk-generate-book-metrics` and `bk-diagram-reports`, update mkdocs.yml nav, and run the verification bash check. Report which files were created, skipped, or missing.

### Example 16: Install Slide Viewer and Generate Chapter Slides
**User:** "install the slide viewer and make slides for chapters 1 and 2" or "generate slides for chapter 3"
**Routing:** Keywords "slide", "slides", "slide viewer", "generate slides", "slide deck" → `references/slide-generator.md`
**Action:** Read slide-generator.md, copy the slide-viewer assets into docs/sims/slide-viewer/, ask which chapters to generate decks for, create slides.md for each (title + content slides separated by `---` + retrieval check + bridge + celebration), add the three-button nav bar to each chapter's index.md, restructure the chapter's mkdocs.yml entry into Content/Slides sub-entries, and append deck links to the viewer's index.md

## Common Workflows

### Full Project Setup
For a complete new project, users typically run these installations in order:
1. `mkdocs-template.md` - Create the project structure
2. `cover-image-generator.md` - Auto-generate cover image using AI
3. `home-page-template.md` - Configure home page with cover image metadata
4. `social-media-preview.md` - Install the og:* / twitter:* meta-tag hook (verify with `bk-check-social-cover`)
5. `learning-graph-viewer.md` - Add graph visualization (after learning graph exists)
6. `skill-tracker.md` - Enable usage analytics (optional)
7. `supplementary-content-generator.md` - Generate all supplementary content once chapters exist (glossary, FAQ, quizzes, references, metrics, about, README)

### Verification Commands

After any installation, verify with:
```bash
# For MkDocs projects
mkdocs serve
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/[project-name]/

# For skill tracker
cat ~/.claude/activity-logs/skill-usage.jsonl | tail -5
```
