Type a number or feature name to install.

Note: If you see `navigation.tabs` in mkdocs.yml, remove it. These books
use side navigation optimized for wide landscape screens.
```

After displaying the list, wait for user to specify which feature they want.

---

## Step 1b: Check for Navigation Tabs (Existing Projects)

When working with an existing mkdocs.yml, always check for and remove navigation tabs:

```yaml
# REMOVE these lines if present in mkdocs.yml:
theme:
  features:
    - navigation.tabs        # DELETE
    - navigation.tabs.sticky # DELETE
```

These books use side navigation optimized for wide landscape screens. Top navigation tabs waste vertical space and are not appropriate for this format.

---

## Step 2: Identify Installation Type

Match the user's request to the appropriate installation guide:

- JavaScript files to create
- CSS files to create
- Usage examples

**Use when:**
- User selects a feature by number or name
- User wants detailed configuration for a specific feature
- User has a minimal mkdocs.yml and wants to enrich it

### init-textbook.md (feature 0)

**Purpose:** The canonical scaffold for a brand-new intelligent textbook in an empty directory

**Creates:**
- mkdocs.yml (side nav, search, admonitions, arithmatex, exclude_docs, schema URI)
- docs/ tree: index, about, course-description, contact, license, chapters/, learning-graph/, sims/, css/extra.css, img/ (cover + license badge)
- plugins/social_override.py hook (per-page og:/twitter: image override)
- .gitignore and VS Code workspace file
- MicroSim status-indicator plumbing (scaffold/built/approved)

**Templates:** single canonical copy in `assets/init-textbook/`

**Prerequisites:**
- Empty (or nearly empty) project directory — refuses to overwrite mkdocs.yml, docs/index.md, or docs/license.md

### google-analytics.md (feature 25)

**Purpose:** Register the book as a Google Analytics 4 property and wire the Measurement ID into mkdocs.yml

**Creates:**
- GA4 property + web data stream (via Claude in Chrome)
- `extra.analytics` block in mkdocs.yml with the G-* Measurement ID
- Build-time tag verification, commit, and gh-deploy

**Prerequisites:**
- Claude in Chrome extension connected; user logged into Google Analytics
- site_url set in mkdocs.yml

### learning-graph-viewer.md

**Purpose:** Add interactive learning graph exploration to existing textbook

**Creates:**
- Interactive vis-network graph viewer
- Search, filtering, and statistics features
- Integration with existing learning-graph.json

**Prerequisites:**
- Existing MkDocs project
- learning-graph.json file present

### skill-tracker.md

**Purpose:** Set up Claude Code skill usage tracking

**Creates:**
- Hook scripts for tracking skill invocations
- Activity log directory structure
- Reporting scripts for usage analysis

**Prerequisites:**

- ~/.claude directory exists

### social-media-preview.md

**Purpose:** Install a Cairo-free MkDocs hook that emits Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags on every page

**Creates:**
- `plugins/social_override.py` — `on_post_page` hook that injects/replaces `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:type`, `og:url`, and `twitter:*` tags
- `hooks:` block in `mkdocs.yml` referencing the new file

**Features:**
- Reads `image:`, `title:`, `description:` from each page's frontmatter; falls back to `img/cover.png` and the site-wide values
- Emits absolute `og:image` URLs by joining `site_url` with the image path (so crawlers and `bk-check-social-cover` can HEAD-request them)
- Works without `mkdocs-material[imaging]` / Cairo — the common-case default
- Compatible with the full `social` plugin when Cairo is present: replaces its auto-generated `/assets/images/social/...` URLs with the declared `cover.png`
- Verified via `~/.local/bin/bk-check-social-cover` (which enforces `og:image` basename = `cover.png` and image reachability)

**Prerequisites:**
- Existing MkDocs Material project with `site_url:` set
- `docs/img/cover.png` (use `cover-image-generator.md` or `home-page-template.md` first if missing)

- mkdocs.yml updates for `custom_dir` and `static_templates`

**Features:**
- Uses the mascot's warning pose (or other pose) centered on the page
- Inherits full site navigation (header, sidebar, footer) from the Material theme
- Customizable message matched to the mascot's personality and voice
- Absolute image paths so the 404 works from any URL depth

**Prerequisites:**
- Existing MkDocs Material project
- Learning mascot images in `docs/img/mascot/` (use `learning-mascot.md` first if needed)

### book-metrics.md

**Purpose:** Generate comprehensive book-wide and per-chapter metrics for an intelligent textbook

**Creates:**
- `docs/learning-graph/book-metrics.md` — Book Composition + Student-Facing Content Metrics tables
- `docs/learning-graph/chapter-metrics.md` — per-chapter breakdown
- merges a `metrics` block of book-wide totals into `docs/learning-graph/book-metadata.json` (author fields preserved)

**Uses script:** `bk-generate-book-metrics` (resolves `$BK_HOME/src/book-metrics/book-metrics.py`); fallback `python3 "$BK_HOME/src/book-metrics/book-metrics.py" docs`

**Features:**
- Tracks all 12 book-composition elements with Required/Recommended/Optional status
- Counts concepts, chapters, MicroSims, stories, glossary terms, FAQs, quiz questions, references, diagrams, equations, words, links, appendices, mascot poses

**Uses script:** `scripts/generate-favicon.py`

**How it works:**
- Detects the bounding box of non-transparent pixels (trims invisible padding)
- Centers the visible content on a square canvas with configurable padding
- Downscales to each favicon size using Lanczos resampling
- Supports transparent or white background canvas

**Prerequisites:**
- Mascot image at `docs/img/mascot/neutral.png` (image need not be square)
- Python `Pillow` library (`pip install Pillow`)

### cover-image-generator.md

**Purpose:** Craft a high-quality cover image prompt at `docs/img/cover-image-prompt.md`, built from the book's title, course description, concept list, mascot, and MicroSim screenshots. Image auto-generation is optional and only runs if the user explicitly asks for it.

**Provides:**
- Guidance for selecting 6-10 montage concepts from the book's own content
- A detailed prompt template covering subject/tone, title typography, montage, mascot, style/color, and things to avoid
- Recommended manual review loop: paste the prompt into a text-to-image tool, compare drafts, iterate on the prompt before finalizing
- Optional automated paths (API, browser automation, or local-prompt) with troubleshooting — only used on explicit request

**Prerequisites:**
- Existing MkDocs project with mkdocs.yml
- docs/course-description.md with book content description
- Only if auto-generation is requested: OpenAI API billing, ChatGPT Pro subscription, or a free AI image generator

### kanban-board.md

**Purpose:** Create a GitHub Projects (v2) Kanban board for tracking textbook development progress

**Creates:**
- GitHub Projects board with Board (Kanban) layout
- Priority field (High / Medium / Low)
- 13 standard textbook milestone draft items
- `docs/project-management.md` with column documentation and workflow guide
- README section about the Kanban board

**Features:**
- Automated setup via `gh project` CLI commands
- Links project to the repository automatically
- Pre-populated milestones matching the 12-step textbook workflow
- Fallback instructions for manual setup if `gh` commands fail

**Prerequisites:**
- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
- `project` scope on the GitHub token (`gh auth refresh -s project`)
- Existing MkDocs project with mkdocs.yml

### supplementary-content-generator.md

**Purpose:** Generate all standard supplementary content for an intelligent textbook in a single coordinated workflow

**Produces (in execution order):**
- `docs/about.md` — professional about page (via `about-page.md` reference)
- `docs/glossary.md` — ISO 11179-compliant glossary (via `glossary-generator` skill)
- `docs/faq.md` — ≥ 30-question FAQ (via `faq-generator` skill)
- `docs/chapters/*/quiz.md` — per-chapter quizzes (via `quiz-generator` skill)
- `docs/chapters/*/references.md` — per-chapter reference lists (via `reference-generator` skill)
- `docs/img/cover.png` — book cover image + social-preview hook (via `cover-image-generator.md` + `social-media-preview.md`)
- Book metrics report (via `bk-generate-book-metrics` script)
- Optional legacy diagram-specification reports (via `bk-diagram-reports`; only when the source schema exists)
- `README.md` — GitHub-facing README after metrics, so it can embed content counts (via the `book-publisher` readme route — skill)
- `docs/index.md` — main landing page last, so it can link to all of the above (via `home-page-template.md`)
- Updated `mkdocs.yml` nav entries for all generated files

**Execution order:** about → glossary → FAQ → quizzes → references → cover image → metrics → optional legacy diagram-specification reports → README → landing page → nav update → verification

**Model guidance:** All text-generation steps use Sonnet. Any MicroSim created during this workflow must use `claude-opus-4-7` with `high` thinking — Opus is significantly better at the coding and spatial reasoning MicroSims require.

**Prerequisites:**
- Existing MkDocs project with `mkdocs.yml`
- `docs/course-description.md` present
- `docs/learning-graph/learning-graph.json` present
- At least one chapter under `docs/chapters/`

### slide-generator.md

**Purpose:** Install the slide-viewer MicroSim into an intelligent textbook project and generate presentation-style `slides.md` decks for specified chapters

**Creates:**
- `docs/sims/slide-viewer/` — viewer shell (main.html, script.js, local.css, index.md) that fetches any rendered MkDocs page URL, splits its content on `<hr>` elements, and renders one slide at a time with keyboard + button navigation
- `docs/chapters/<slug>/slides.md` — per chapter: title slide, content slides separated by `---`, retrieval check, bridge, celebration close
- Three-button nav bar (`Content`, `Slides`, `Slides in Viewer`) at the top of each chapter's `index.md` and its `slides.md`
- mkdocs.yml nav restructured so each chapter with slides has `Content` / `Slides` sub-entries

**Features:**
- Viewer reads MkDocs' rendered HTML (never raw `.md` — MkDocs doesn't serve `.md` directly)
- Mascot integration: neutral pose on every slide, celebration pose on the last slide (uses `docs/img/mascot/neutral.png` and `celebration.png` if present; silently absent otherwise)
- First/last-slide jump buttons, `Home`/`End` keys, fullscreen, table-of-contents overlay
- Distills chapter `index.md` into 15–28 slides following project voice/style rules

**Prerequisites:**
- Existing MkDocs Material project with `docs/chapters/` populated
- Chapter `index.md` files with real content (not just scaffold) — guide checks line counts before generating
- Optional: mascot installed via `learning-mascot.md`

### mascot-chapter-updater.md

**Purpose:** Retrofit an existing chapter markdown file with mascot admonitions in the right places, following the placement rules from learning-mascot.md

**Creates:**
- In-place edits to the specified chapter file only (no new files)
- A placement plan shown to the user for confirmation before editing

**Features:**
- LLM-driven workflow for semantic placement (no regex auto-insertion)
- Enforces hard limits: ≤6 admonitions per chapter, one welcome and one celebration maximum, no back-to-back placements
- Image-path guidance for directory-URL rendering (counts `../` from rendered page)
- Voice and body-text rules: 1-3 sentences, in-character, specific to chapter content
- Validation via `scripts/validate-chapter-mascots.py` that flags count limits, back-to-backs, missing `<img>` tags, and body-text length

**Prerequisites:**
- Mascot images present in `docs/img/mascot/` or `docs/img/mascots/`
- `docs/css/mascot.css` loaded and the mascot-test page renders correctly
- Specific chapter file identified by absolute path

## Common Workflows

### Full Project Setup
For a complete new project, users typically run these installations in order:
1. `init-textbook.md` - Scaffold the project structure (feature 0)
2. `cover-image-generator.md` - Generate a high-quality cover image prompt (auto-generation optional, on request)
3. `home-page-template.md` - Configure home page with cover image metadata
4. `social-media-preview.md` - Install the og:* / twitter:* meta-tag hook (verify with `bk-check-social-cover`)
5. `learning-graph-viewer.md` - Add graph visualization (after learning graph exists)
6. `skill-tracker.md` - Enable usage analytics (optional)
7. `google-analytics.md` - Register the book with GA4 (feature 25, optional)
8. `supplementary-content-generator.md` - Generate all supplementary content once chapters exist (glossary, FAQ, quizzes, references, metrics, about, README)

### Verification Commands

After any installation, verify with:
```bash
# For MkDocs projects
mkdocs serve
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/[project-name]/

# For skill tracker
cat ~/.claude/activity-logs/skill-usage.jsonl | tail -5
```
