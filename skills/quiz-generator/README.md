# Quiz Generator Skill

Automatically generate interactive multiple-choice quizzes for textbook chapters with Bloom's Taxonomy alignment and mkdocs-material question admonition formatting.

## Overview

This skill converts chapter content into high-quality multiple-choice quiz questions. Questions are aligned to learning graph concepts, distributed across Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive levels, and formatted using mkdocs-material question admonitions with upper-alpha (A, B, C, D) answer choices.

**Version 0.4 Features:**
- **Serial execution** - One agent carries shared context across every chapter
- **Stable output** - Quiz formatting, scoring, and navigation follow one contract
- **Lower overhead** - Avoids repeated agent startup context and conflicting file edits

## Installation

To use this skill with Claude Code or Claude.ai:

1. Install the skill by providing the path to this directory
2. The skill will be available for Claude to use when generating quizzes

## Usage

**Trigger Phrases:**

- "Generate a quiz for Chapter 3"
- "Create quiz questions for my chapter"
- "Build a quiz from this content"
- "Generate quizzes for all chapters"
- "Run /quiz-generator" (invoke the skill directly)

**Prerequisites:**

- Chapter content exists (1000+ words per chapter recommended)
- Learning graph created (`docs/learning-graph/learning-graph.csv`)
- Glossary available (`docs/glossary.md`) - recommended
- Course description with learning outcomes - optional

## Execution Modes

### Serial Mode (Default)

The skill uses one agent to process chapters sequentially. The agent reads the
shared course context once, carries what it learns from earlier chapters into
later chapters, and applies all navigation changes in one serialized edit.
This avoids repeated startup overhead, inconsistent quiz strategies, and
conflicting edits to `mkdocs.yml`.

### Single Chapter Mode

For updating one quiz: "Generate a quiz for Chapter 3 only"

**Typical Workflow:**

1. User asks Claude to generate quizzes for all chapters
2. Skill reads shared context (course description, glossary, learning graph)
3. One agent processes chapters in order and generates 10 questions per chapter
4. The same agent validates answer balance, Bloom's distribution, and concept coverage
5. Skill generates the aggregate quality report
6. Skill applies all `mkdocs.yml` navigation changes in one edit
7. Skill logs the session with timing information

## Question Format

All questions use the mkdocs-material question admonition format:

```markdown
#### 1. What is the primary purpose of a learning graph?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To create visual decorations for textbooks
2. To map prerequisite relationships between concepts
3. To generate random quiz questions
4. To organize files in a directory structure
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A learning graph is a directed graph that maps prerequisite relationships between concepts, showing which concepts must be learned before others.

    **Concept Tested:** Learning Graph

    **See:** [Learning Graph Concept](../concepts/learning-graph.md)
```

**Key Formatting Elements:**

- Level-4 header (####) with question number
- `<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>` wrapper for upper-alpha styling
- Numbered list (1, 2, 3, 4) that renders as A, B, C, D
- `??? question "Show Answer"` admonition
- Indented answer block (4 spaces)
- "The correct answer is **[LETTER]**." statement
- Concept tested and source link

## Quality Standards

### Content Readiness Score (1-100)

Assesses whether chapter content is sufficient for quality quiz:

- **90-100:** Rich content (2000+ words, examples, clear concepts)
- **70-89:** Good content (1000-2000 words, some examples)
- **50-69:** Basic content (500-1000 words, limited examples)
- **Below 50:** Insufficient content

### Quiz Quality Score (1-100)

Five components:

1. **Question Quality (30 pts):** Clear, unambiguous, well-formed
2. **Bloom's Distribution (25 pts):** Matches target for chapter type
3. **Concept Coverage (20 pts):** Tests 75%+ of major concepts
4. **Answer Balance (15 pts):** Correct answers evenly distributed
5. **Pedagogical Value (10 pts):** Explanations teach, links provided

### Bloom's Taxonomy Targets

**Introductory Chapters:**
- 40% Remember, 40% Understand, 15% Apply, 5% Analyze

**Intermediate Chapters:**
- 25% Remember, 30% Understand, 30% Apply, 15% Analyze

**Advanced Chapters:**
- 15% Remember, 20% Understand, 25% Apply, 25% Analyze, 10% Evaluate, 5% Create

### Success Criteria

- Overall quality score > 70/100
- 8-12 questions generated
- Bloom's distribution within ±15% of target
- 75%+ concept coverage
- Answer balance within 20-30% per option (A, B, C, D)
- 100% questions have explanations
- No duplicate questions

# Quiz: Learning Graphs

Test your understanding of learning graphs with these questions.

#### 1. What is the primary purpose of a learning graph?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To create visual decorations for textbooks
2. To map prerequisite relationships between concepts
3. To generate random quiz questions
4. To organize files in a directory structure
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A learning graph is a directed graph that maps prerequisite relationships between concepts, ensuring students learn foundational concepts before advanced ones.

    **Concept Tested:** Learning Graph

    **See:** [Learning Graph Concept](../concepts/learning-graph.md)

---

#### 2. Which data structure prevents cycles in a learning graph?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Linked list
2. Directed acyclic graph
3. Directed cyclic graph
4. Undirected graph
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is specifically designed to prevent cycles, which is essential for learning graphs because circular dependencies would create impossible prerequisite chains.

    **Concept Tested:** Directed Acyclic Graph

    **See:** [Learning Graph Structure](../concepts/learning-graph.md#structure)

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Ensure sufficient content** - 1000+ words per chapter for quality quizzes
2. **Review generated quizzes** - Check for accuracy and appropriate difficulty
3. **Validate links** - Ensure all references point to correct sections
4. **Test rendering** - Preview questions in mkdocs to verify formatting
5. **Iterate as needed** - Refine based on quality report recommendations

### For Quiz Generation

1. **Balance Bloom's levels** - Don't over-focus on Remember/Understand
2. **Create quality distractors** - All wrong answers should be plausible
3. **Write teaching explanations** - Don't just confirm, explain why
4. **Vary correct answer position** - Avoid patterns (all C's, alternating, etc.)
5. **Link to sources** - Reference chapter sections for deeper learning
6. **Test major concepts** - Focus on important concepts, not trivial details

## Troubleshooting

### "Content readiness score is low (<60)"

**Cause:** Chapter has insufficient content for quality quiz

**Solution:**
- Write more chapter content (target: 1000+ words)
- Add examples for key concepts
- Ensure concepts are clearly explained
- Verify glossary coverage

### "Bloom's distribution is imbalanced"

**Cause:** Too many questions at one cognitive level

**Solution:**
- Review chapter type (introductory, intermediate, advanced)
- Check target distribution for that chapter type
- Add more higher-level questions (Apply, Analyze, Evaluate)
- Reduce excessive Remember/Understand questions

### "Answer balance is poor"

**Cause:** Correct answers clustered on one option (e.g., all B's)

**Solution:**
- Randomize correct answer placement
- Target: 25% each for A, B, C, D (±5% acceptable)
- Avoid patterns (A-B-A-B, all C's, etc.)
- Check after each question added

### "Question admonition not rendering"

**Cause:** Formatting error in markdown

**Solution:**
- Verify `<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>` wrapper present
- Check numbered list uses 1, 2, 3, 4 (not A, B, C, D)
- Ensure closing `</div>` tag exists
- Verify 4-space indentation in answer block
- Check blank lines before and after div

### "Distractors are too obvious"

**Cause:** Wrong answers not plausible

**Solution:**
- Review distractor writing guide
- Use related terminology
- Base on common misconceptions
- Ensure similar length to correct answer
- Avoid nonsense or joke options
