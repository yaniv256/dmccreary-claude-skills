# Course Description Analyzer

## Overview

This Anthropic Claude Skill is the first step in the process of generating an intelligent textbook.
The next Skill is the 'learning-graph-generator` Skill.

Analyze or create high-quality course descriptions that contain all necessary elements for generating comprehensive learning graphs with 200+ concepts. Check the `/docs/course-description.md` file for completeness, quality, and alignment with 2001 Bloom's Taxonomy learning outcomes.

## Workflow Decision Tree

Start by checking if `/docs/course-description.md` exists:

- **File does not exist** → Follow **Creation Workflow** (Step 1)
- **File exists** → Follow **Analysis Workflow** (Step 2)

Tell the user that they are running Version 0.03 of the Course Description Analyzer Skill.

## Step 1: Course Description Creation

Use this workflow when `/docs/course-description.md` does not exist.

### 1.1 Gather Course Information

Ask the user the following questions sequentially (not all at once):

1. **What is the title of the course?**

2. **What is the target audience of the course?**
   - Options: elementary, junior high, high school, college undergraduate, graduate students, adult continuing education, professional development, or other

3. **What are the prerequisites for this course?**
   - If none, explicitly state "None"

4. **What are the main subjects/topics covered by this course?**
   - Request a list of major topics

5. **What are the learning outcomes organized by the 2001 Bloom's Taxonomy?**
   - Explain that after this course, students will be able to demonstrate competencies at each level:
     - **Remember**: Retrieve, recognize, and recall relevant knowledge
     - **Understand**: Construct meaning from instructional messages
     - **Apply**: Carry out or use procedures in given situations
     - **Analyze**: Break material into parts and determine relationships
     - **Evaluate**: Make judgments based on criteria and standards
     - **Create**: Put elements together to form coherent wholes; includes capstone projects

### 1.2 Generate Course Description

Use the template from `assets/course-description-template.md` and populate it with the user's responses. Create the file at `/docs/course-description.md`.

Ensure the generated file includes:
- Clear course title
- Target audience specification
- Prerequisites (or "None")
- Comprehensive list of main topics
- Section for topics NOT covered (to set boundaries)
- Detailed learning outcomes organized by all six Bloom's Taxonomy levels
- Descriptive text explaining why the course is important

### 1.3 After Creation

After creating the file, automatically proceed to **Step 2 (Analysis Workflow)** to validate the newly created course description and provide a quality score.

## Step 2: Course Description Analysis

Use this workflow when `/docs/course-description.md` already exists.

### 2.1 Read the Course Description

Read `/docs/course-description.md` and analyze its contents against the quality criteria.

### 2.2 Course Description Quality Scoring System

Evaluate the course description using this 100-point scoring system:

| Element | Points | Criteria |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Title** | 5 | Clear, descriptive course title present |
| **Target Audience** | 5 | Specific audience identified (e.g., "college undergraduate") |
| **Prerequisites** | 5 | Prerequisites listed or explicitly stated as "None" |
| **Main Topics Covered** | 10 | Comprehensive list of topics (ideally 5-10 topics) |
| **Topics Excluded** | 5 | Clear boundaries set for what's NOT covered |
| **Learning Outcomes Header** | 5 | Clear statement: "After this course, students will be able to..." |
| **Remember Level** | 10 | Multiple specific outcomes for remembering/recalling |
| **Understand Level** | 10 | Multiple specific outcomes for understanding/explaining |
| **Apply Level** | 10 | Multiple specific outcomes for applying/using |
| **Analyze Level** | 10 | Multiple specific outcomes for analyzing/breaking down |
| **Evaluate Level** | 10 | Multiple specific outcomes for evaluating/judging |
| **Create Level** | 10 | Multiple specific outcomes for creating/synthesizing; includes capstone ideas |
| **Descriptive Context** | 5 | Additional context about course importance, relevance, or value |

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- Award full points if element is complete and high-quality
- Award partial points if element is present but incomplete or vague
- Award 0 points if element is missing
- For Bloom's Taxonomy levels, require at least 3 specific, actionable outcomes for full points

### 2.3 Gap Analysis

Identify missing or weak elements:
- List each element that scored less than full points
- Explain what is missing or insufficient
- Indicate how the absence impacts learning graph generation

### 2.4 Improvement Suggestions

Provide specific, actionable recommendations:
- For missing elements: Suggest what should be added
- For weak elements: Provide examples of how to strengthen them
- For Bloom's Taxonomy outcomes: Recommend specific verbs and topics
- Prioritize suggestions that will have the most impact on reaching the goal of generating 200 concepts

### 2.5 Course Description Assessment Report

Use `mkdir -p docs/learning-graph` to create a `learning-graph` directory in the docs directory.

Generate a comprehensive quality report on the course description and write it to `docs/learning-graph/course-description-assessment.md`

1. **Overall Score**: X/100
2. **Quality Rating**:
   - 90-100: Excellent - Ready for learning graph generation
   - 75-89: Good - Minor improvements recommended
   - 60-74: Adequate - Several improvements needed
   - 40-59: Fair - Significant gaps to address
   - 0-39: Poor - Major revision required

3. **Detailed Scoring Breakdown**: Show points earned for each element
4. **Gap Analysis**: List of missing or weak elements
5. **Improvement Suggestions**: Prioritized recommendations
6. **Next Steps**:
   - If score ≥ 85: Ready to proceed with learning graph generation
   - If score < 85: Recommend addressing specific gaps before generating learning graph

### 2.6 Update Course Description Metadata

In this section NAME is the name of the course taken from the course description.
QUALITY_SCORE is the score you computed for the course description.

If it does not exist, add the following yml metadata at the top of the docs/course-description.md file:

```yml
---
title: Course Description for Course NAME
description: A detailed course description for NAME including overview, topics covered and learning objectives in the format of the 2001 Bloom Taxonomy
quality_score: QUALITY_SCORE
---
```

### 2.7 Concept Generation Readiness

Assess whether the course description contains sufficient detail to generate 200 concepts:
- Evaluate topic breadth and depth
- Check if Bloom's Taxonomy outcomes suggest diverse concept types
- Estimate potential concept count based on current content
- Recommend additions if concept generation may fall short

### Add course-description.md and and the course-description-assessment.md to mkdocs.yml Navigation

After the course-description.md file has been added to the /docs direction,
ask the user if the new file should be added to the mkdocs.yml file.
If the answer is yes, place the new file after the about.md file.

```yml
nav:
   ...
   About: about.md
   Course Description: course-description.md
   ...
   Learning Graph:
      Course Description Assessment: learning-graph/course-description-assessment.md
```

## Next Step

For all users with a score over 85, ask if the `learning-graph-generator` skill should be run next.

## Best Practices

When using this skill:

1. **Be thorough**: Don't skip Bloom's Taxonomy levels—all six are essential for comprehensive learning
2. **Be specific**: Vague outcomes like "understand the material" won't support quality learning graphs
3. **Use action verbs**: Each outcome should start with a measurable verb (list, explain, apply, analyze, evaluate, design, etc.)
4. **Think concepts**: Each topic and outcome should suggest multiple learnable concepts
5. **Set boundaries**: Topics excluded are as important as topics covered for scope management
