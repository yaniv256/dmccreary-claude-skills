# Reference Generator

## Overview

Generate high-quality, curated reference lists for educational textbooks. Each chapter receives exactly 10 references, prioritizing Wikipedia articles first for reliability, followed by authoritative online resources. References are stored in separate `references.md` files for token-efficient maintenance by AI agents.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Creating a new intelligent textbook that needs chapter references
- Adding references to an existing textbook
- Updating or expanding references for educational content
- A user explicitly requests reference generation

## Key Principles

### 10 References Per Chapter

Every chapter receives exactly **10 high-quality references**:

- **References 1-3**: Wikipedia articles (most reliable, always accessible)
- **References 4-5**: Authoritative textbooks (title, author, publisher - no URLs that break)
- **References 6-10**: Online resources (tutorials, courses, verified working links)

### Wikipedia First

Wikipedia links are placed first because they:

- Have stable, reliable URLs that rarely break
- Provide comprehensive, well-sourced overviews
- Are freely accessible to all students
- Cover most technical topics thoroughly
- Are maintained and updated by the community

### Separate Reference Files

References are stored in separate `references.md` files (not inline in chapters) for:

- **Token efficiency**: ~150 tokens vs ~6,000 tokens to read/update
- **Batch processing**: Agents can glob `**/references.md` for bulk updates
- **Separation of concerns**: Chapter edits don't risk breaking references

## Reference Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze the Course Description

Read the `/docs/course-description.md` file to determine:

- **Subject matter** - determines reference topics
- **Target audience** - guides complexity of descriptions
- **Learning objectives** - ensures references support goals

### Step 2: Identify Chapter Structure

Locate all chapter directories:

```bash
# Find chapter folders
ls docs/chapters/
```

By default, process every chapter. When the user or an invoking workflow supplies
one or more chapter paths, process only those chapters. Read each selected
chapter's `index.md` to understand:

- Chapter title and topic
- Key concepts covered
- Learning objectives

### Step 3: Generate 10 References Per Chapter

For each chapter, create exactly 10 references following this priority:

**Positions 1-3: Wikipedia Articles**

Find the most relevant Wikipedia articles for the chapter's main concepts:

```markdown
1. [Concept Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_Name) - Wikipedia - Description of article content and relevance to chapter.
```

**Positions 4-5: Textbooks (No URL)**

Reference authoritative textbooks without URLs (which often break):

```markdown
4. Textbook Title (Edition) - Author Name - Publisher - Description of relevant chapters and why this textbook is valuable.
```

**Positions 6-10: Online Resources**

Verified online tutorials, courses, and educational sites:

```markdown
6. [Resource Title](https://verified-url.com/path) - Source Name - Description of content and specific relevance to chapter topics.
```

### Step 4: Verify Online URLs

For references 6-10, verify each URL:

```python
WebFetch(url=reference_url, prompt="Is this page accessible? What is the main topic?")
```

**Preferred sources** (stable, educational):
- All About Circuits (allaboutcircuits.com)
- Electronics Tutorials (electronics-tutorials.ws)
- ChipVerify (chipverify.com)
- HDLBits (hdlbits.01xz.net)
- Nandland (nandland.com)
- MIT OpenCourseWare (ocw.mit.edu)
- GeeksforGeeks (geeksforgeeks.org)
- Digilent Reference (digilent.com/reference)

### Step 5: Write Reference Files

Create a `references.md` file in each chapter directory:

**File location**: `docs/chapters/XX-chapter-name/references.md`

**File format**:

```markdown
# References: [Chapter Title]

1. [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic) - Wikipedia - Comprehensive overview of [topic] including [specific aspects relevant to chapter].

2. [Wikipedia Article 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic2) - Wikipedia - Detailed explanation of [concept] with [relevant details].

3. [Wikipedia Article 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic3) - Wikipedia - Coverage of [related topic] including [applications/examples].

4. Textbook Title (Edition) - Author Name - Publisher - Chapter X covers [specific topics] with [teaching approach/examples].

5. Textbook Title 2 - Author Name - Publisher - Provides [specific value] for understanding [chapter concepts].

6. [Online Resource](https://verified-url.com) - Source - Tutorial on [topic] with [specific features like examples, exercises, visualizations].

7. [Online Resource 2](https://verified-url.com) - Source - [Description of content and relevance].

8. [Online Resource 3](https://verified-url.com) - Source - [Description of content and relevance].

9. [Online Resource 4](https://verified-url.com) - Source - [Description of content and relevance].

10. [Online Resource 5](https://verified-url.com) - Source - [Description of content and relevance].
```

### Step 6: Update Chapter Files

Add a link at the end of each chapter's `index.md`:

```markdown
[See Annotated References](./references.md)
```

**Important**: Replace any existing `## References` section with this single link.

### Step 7: Update mkdocs.yml Navigation

By default, nest an `Annotated References:` entry under each selected chapter in
`mkdocs.yml`, following the canonical nav-editing rules (read-before-write,
serialize edits, `Content:` label for the chapter page) in
`$HOME/.claude/skills/book-installer/references/mkdocs-nav-editing.md`.

When an invoking workflow explicitly says to defer navigation, do not edit
`mkdocs.yml`. Return the complete set of `Annotated References` entries to that
workflow so it can include them in its own serialized navigation edit.

The navigation shape is:

```yaml
  - 1. Chapter Name:
    - Content: chapters/01-chapter-folder/index.md
    - Quiz: chapters/01-chapter-folder/quiz.md
    - Annotated References: chapters/01-chapter-folder/references.md
```

## Reference Quality Guidelines

### Description Requirements

Each reference description should:

- Explain **what** the resource covers (1 sentence)
- Explain **why** it's relevant to this chapter (1 sentence)
- Mention specific features (examples, exercises, visualizations)
- Be 20-40 words total

**Good example**:
```markdown
1. [Karnaugh map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map) - Wikipedia - Detailed explanation of K-map theory, grouping rules, and don't-care conditions. Essential foundation for the simplification techniques covered in this chapter.
```

**Bad example**:
```markdown
1. [Karnaugh map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map) - Wikipedia - About K-maps.
```

### Wikipedia Article Selection

Choose Wikipedia articles that:

- Cover the chapter's primary concepts
- Have substantial content (not stubs)
- Include diagrams, examples, or formulas
- Link to related topics students might explore

### Textbook Selection

Reference textbooks that:

- Are widely used in the field
- Have strong reputations
- Cover the chapter's topics in depth
- Are reasonably accessible to students

### Online Resource Selection

Choose online resources that:

- Have verified, working URLs
- Come from educational or reputable technical sources
- Provide practical examples or exercises
- Complement (not duplicate) Wikipedia content

## Reference Quality Checklist

Before finalizing references, ensure:

- [ ] Exactly 10 references per chapter
- [ ] References 1-3 are Wikipedia articles
- [ ] References 4-5 are textbooks (no URLs)
- [ ] References 6-10 have verified working URLs
- [ ] All descriptions are 20-40 words
- [ ] Descriptions explain relevance to chapter
- [ ] No duplicate sources across references
- [ ] Proper formatting throughout

## File Structure After Generation

```
docs/chapters/
├── 01-chapter-name/
│   ├── index.md          # Ends with: [See Annotated References](./references.md)
│   ├── quiz.md
│   └── references.md     # 10 curated references
├── 02-chapter-name/
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── quiz.md
│   └── references.md
...
```

## Token Efficiency Benefits

| Task | Inline References | Separate Files |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| Read one chapter's refs | ~6,000 tokens | ~200 tokens |
| Update all 15 chapters | ~90,000 tokens | ~3,000 tokens |
| Batch reference check | Not feasible | Glob + process |

## Finish

After generating references:

1. Report the number of chapters processed
2. List any URLs that failed verification
3. Confirm mkdocs.yml was updated
4. Remind user to verify the site builds: `mkdocs serve`
