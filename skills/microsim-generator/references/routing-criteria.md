## Matching Strategy

### Step-by-Step Matching Process

1. **Extract Key Characteristics**
   - Data type (temporal, geographic, relational, numerical, categorical, mathematical)
   - Visual style (chart, diagram, plot, map, timeline, network)
   - Interactivity needs (static, hover, click, drag, sliders, real-time)
   - Explicit mentions of tools/libraries

2. **Identify Primary Matches**
   - Look for trigger words specific to each generator
   - Match data type to generator specialization
   - Consider visual style requirements

3. **Score Each Generator**
   - Use the 0-100 scale defined for each generator above
   - Consider multiple factors (data, interaction, visual, trigger words)
   - Be honest about limitations

4. **Rank by Score**
   - Sort generators from highest to lowest score
   - Include top 3-5 recommendations minimum
   - Always include at least one score above 50 if possible

5. **Provide Reasoning**
   - Explain why the score is high/low
   - Mention specific features that match or don't match
   - Suggest alternatives if score is low
   - Note any caveats or considerations

## Common Ambiguities and How to Resolve

### "Interactive visualization of data"
- **Clarify**: What type of data? What kind of interaction?
- **Consider**: chartjs-generator (if standard charts), microsim-p5 (if custom)

### "Graph showing..."
- **Clarify**: "Graph" can mean chart (ChartJS) or network graph (vis-network)
- **Look for**: Nodes/edges → vis-network; Data points → chartjs or function plot

### "Diagram of..."
- **Clarify**: Structural (Mermaid), Network (vis-network), or Custom (p5)?
- **Look for**: Process words → Mermaid; Relationship words → vis-network

### "Timeline with events"
- **Clear choice**: timeline-generator (high score)
- **Alternative**: chartjs line chart (lower score)

### "Map of concepts"
- **Clarify**: Geographic map or concept map?
- **Geographic** → map-generator
- **Conceptual** → vis-network or mermaid-generator

---

## Quality Assurance

When providing match scores, ensure:

1. **At least one score ≥ 70**: There should be a good match
2. **Diversity in scores**: Show range of options (don't score everything 50)
3. **Clear reasoning**: Explain scores with specific features
4. **Honesty about limitations**: Don't oversell poor matches
5. **Alternative suggestions**: If primary match has limitations, mention alternatives
6. **Complete ranking**: Include all relevant generators (usually 3-5 minimum)
