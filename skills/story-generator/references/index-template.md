[REPEAT THIS PATTERN FOR EACH PANEL — N panels total, plus the cover.
N defaults to 12 but is configurable via the skill's `--panels N` argument.
For shorter stories (6, 7, 8, 9 panels), follow the same per-panel pattern
and stop at panel N. Update each "panel X of N" identifier line so the
denominator matches the actual N for this story (e.g. "panel 3 of 8" in
an 8-panel story, NOT "panel 3 of 12"). Do not pad with filler panels
just to reach 12 — a tight 6-panel story beats a bloated 12-panel one.]
