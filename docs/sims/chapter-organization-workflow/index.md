## Overview

This flowchart illustrates the decision-making process for organizing chapter content, from initial planning through dependency verification and finalization.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Chapter Planning Initiated** - Start from chapter title, summary, and concept list.
2. **Review Concept Dependencies** - Identify prerequisite relationships from the learning graph.
3. **Linear or Branching Structure?** - Decide between a linear sequence or parallel tracks.
4. **Build Section Structure** - Create either linear sequence or parallel tracks.
5. **Assign and Enrich** - Assign concepts to sections and place non-text learning elements.
6. **All Dependencies Satisfied?** - Verify prerequisite coverage.
7. **Reorganize if Needed** - If prerequisites are missing, reorder and re-check.
8. **Finalize Chapter Structure** - Lock structure and proceed to chapter content generation.

## How to Use

1. Hover over any node to see step details in the right panel.
2. Follow arrows to trace the normal path and the reorganization loop.
3. Compare linear and branching options at the first decision point.

## Key Concepts

- Prerequisite-aware sequencing
- Linear vs branching content flow
- Section-to-concept mapping
- Dependency validation loop
- Content readiness for generation

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After exploring this workflow, students will be able to:

- Explain how concept dependencies shape section order.
- Distinguish when linear vs branching structure is appropriate.
- Verify whether a chapter organization satisfies prerequisite constraints.

### Activities

1. Ask learners to choose a chapter topic and map it through this workflow.
2. Have learners identify where they would place two diagrams and one MicroSim.
3. Run a dependency check and discuss what triggers reorganization.

### Assessment

- Can learners justify linear vs branching choices?
- Can learners identify missing prerequisites in a sample section order?
- Can learners explain why reorganization might repeat before finalization?
