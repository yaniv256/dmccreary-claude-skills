# Reference Generator Skill

!!! warning "Superseded creation transcript"
    This page preserves the prompt and output that created an early version of
    the skill. It is historical evidence, not current operating guidance. The
    current `skills/reference-generator/SKILL.md` requires exactly 10 references
    per chapter in a separate `references.md` file.

!!! prompt
    Please use the skill creator for creating a new skill that creates high-quality references for a textbook.  The references should all be verified links.  Use the format 
  
  1. [Link Title](testing URL) - publication_date - publication_name - description of resource and relevancy to the
  textbook.  
  
  When you generate the references, look at the /docs/course-description.md file for the information such as grade-level, target-audience or prerequisites to gage the level of reader for the references.  For example a text for junior-high students should have fun and engaging references.  
  
  Generate 10 references for junior-high level texts, 
  20 for senior-high students, 
  30 for colleges level students and 
  40 for grad-school level textbooks.  
  
  Use more authoritative peer-reviewed papers for college level references.  Place the results of the references in the file /docs/references.md.  
  
  Note that some users might want to only add reference to the end of a chapter.  If you find chapter content, ask them if they want book-level or chapter-level references.

         8    ## Overview
         9    
        10 -  [TODO: 1-2 sentences explaining what this skill enables]
        10 +  Generate high-quality, verified reference lists for educational textbooks with level-appropriate content and quantity. The skill
           +  analyzes course descriptions to determine the target audience and creates references that match the readers' level, from fun and
           +  engaging resources for junior-high students to authoritative peer-reviewed papers for graduate students.

        12 -  ## Structuring This Skill
        12 +  ## When to Use This Skill
        13    
        14 -  [TODO: Choose the structure that best fits this skill's purpose. Common patterns:
        14 +  Use this skill when:
        15 +  - Creating a new intelligent textbook that needs a comprehensive reference list
        16 +  - Adding references to an existing textbook
        17 +  - Updating or expanding references for educational content
        18 +  - A user explicitly requests reference generation
        19    
        20 -  **1. Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)
        21 -  - Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures
        22 -  - Example: DOCX skill with "Workflow Decision Tree" → "Reading" → "Creating" → "Editing"
        23 -  - Structure: ## Overview → ## Workflow Decision Tree → ## Step 1 → ## Step 2...
        20 +  ## Reference Generation Workflow
        21    
        22 -  **2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)
        23 -  - Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities
        24 -  - Example: PDF skill with "Quick Start" → "Merge PDFs" → "Split PDFs" → "Extract Text"
        25 -  - Structure: ## Overview → ## Quick Start → ## Task Category 1 → ## Task Category 2...
        22 +  ### Step 1: Analyze the Course Description
        23    
        24 -  **3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)
        25 -  - Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements
        26 -  - Example: Brand styling with "Brand Guidelines" → "Colors" → "Typography" → "Features"
        27 -  - Structure: ## Overview → ## Guidelines → ## Specifications → ## Usage...
        24 +  Read the `/docs/course-description.md` file to determine:
        25 +  - **Grade level** or target audience (junior-high, senior-high, college, graduate)
        26 +  - **Prerequisites** - indicates reader sophistication
        27 +  - **Subject matter** - determines reference topics
        28 +  - **Learning objectives** - guides reference selection
        29    
        30 -  **4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)
        31 -  - Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features
        32 -  - Example: Product Management with "Core Capabilities" → numbered capability list
        33 -  - Structure: ## Overview → ## Core Capabilities → ### 1. Feature → ### 2. Feature...
        30 +  The grade level determines:
        31 +  - **Junior-high (middle school)**: 10 references - fun, engaging, visual resources
        32 +  - **Senior-high (high school)**: 20 references - mix of accessible and academic sources
        33 +  - **College (undergraduate)**: 30 references - more academic, some peer-reviewed papers
        34 +  - **Graduate (masters/PhD)**: 40 references - heavily peer-reviewed, authoritative sources
        35    
        36 -  Patterns can be mixed and matched as needed. Most skills combine patterns (e.g., start with task-based, add workflow for complex
           -  operations).
        36 +  ### Step 2: Check for Chapter-Level Content
        37    
        38 -  Delete this entire "Structuring This Skill" section when done - it's just guidance.]
        38 +  Before generating references, search for chapter content in the textbook:
        39    
        40 -  ## [TODO: Replace with the first main section based on chosen structure]
        40 +  ```bash
        41 +  # Look for chapter files
        42 +  find /docs -name "chapter*.md" -o -name "*-chapter-*.md"
        43 +  ```
        44    
        45 -  [TODO: Add content here. See examples in existing skills:
        46 -  - Code samples for technical skills
        47 -  - Decision trees for complex workflows
        48 -  - Concrete examples with realistic user requests
        49 -  - References to scripts/templates/references as needed]
        45 +  If chapter content exists, use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask:
        46 +  - "Would you like book-level references (in /docs/references.md) or chapter-level references (at the end of each chapter)?"
        47    
        48 -  ## Resources

       110 +  
       111 +  ### Step 5: Write References to File
       112 +  
       113 +  **For book-level references:**
       114 +  Create or overwrite `/docs/references.md` with:
       115 +  
       116 +  ```markdown
       117 +  # References
       118 +  
       119 +  This textbook draws upon the following high-quality resources:
       120 +  
       121 +  [Generated numbered list of references]
       122 +  
       123    ---
       124 +  *References last updated: [Current Date]*
       125 +  ```
       126    
       127 -  **Any unneeded directories can be deleted.** Not every skill requires all three types of resources.
       127 +  **For chapter-level references:**
       128 +  Append to each chapter file (e.g., `/docs/chapter-01.md`):
       129 +  
       130 +  ```markdown
       131 +  
       132 +  ## References
       133 +  
       134 +  [Generated numbered list of references for this chapter]
       135 +  ```
       136 +  
       137 +  ### Step 6: Validation and Reporting
       138 +  
       139 +  After generating references:
       140 +  
       141 +  1. **Count the references** to ensure correct quantity for level
       142 +  2. **Verify all URLs** were checked with WebFetch
       143 +  3. **Report summary** to user:
       144 +     - Number of references generated
       145 +     - Target level identified
       146 +     - File location
       147 +     - Any URLs that failed verification (if any)
       148 +  
       149 +  ## URL Verification Process
       150 +  
       151 +  **Critical**: Every URL must be verified before inclusion.
       152 +  
       153 +  ```python
       154 +  # Use WebFetch for each URL
       155 +  WebFetch(url=reference_url, prompt="Is this page accessible? Provide the title and a brief description of the content.")
       156 +  ```
       157 +  
       158 +  If a URL returns an error or redirect:
       159 +  - Try to find an updated or archived version
       160 +  - Use Internet Archive / Wayback Machine if appropriate
       161 +  - Skip the reference if no valid URL exists
       162 +  - Note in the report any references that couldn't be verified
       163 +  
       164 +  ## Reference Quality Checklist
       165 +  
       166 +  Before finalizing references, ensure:
       167 +  - [ ] Correct quantity for target level (10/20/30/40)
       168 +  - [ ] All URLs verified and accessible
       169 +  - [ ] Publication dates included
       170 +  - [ ] Mix of resource types (articles, videos, papers)
       171 +  - [ ] Descriptions explain relevance to textbook
       172 +  - [ ] Academic rigor matches target audience
       173 +  - [ ] No duplicate sources
       174 +  - [ ] Proper formatting throughout
       175 +  
       176 +  ## Example Usage Scenarios
       177 +  
       178 +  **Scenario 1: New textbook**
       179 +  ```
       180 +  User: "Generate references for my textbook"
       181 +  → Read /docs/course-description.md
       182 +  → Identify level (e.g., college)
       183 +  → Check for chapters (none found)
       184 +  → Generate 30 verified references
       185 +  → Write to /docs/references.md
       186 +  ```
       187 +  
       188 +  **Scenario 2: Existing textbook with chapters**
       189 +  ```
       190 +  User: "Add references to my course"
       191 +  → Read /docs/course-description.md
       192 +  → Find chapter files exist
       193 +  → Ask: "Book-level or chapter-level references?"
       194 +  → User selects chapter-level
       195 +  → Generate references for each chapter
       196 +  → Append to each chapter file
       197 +  ```
       198 +  
       199 +  ## Resources
       200 +  
       201 +  This skill uses web-based verification tools built into Claude Code:
       202 +  - **WebSearch**: Find authoritative sources on topics
       203 +  - **WebFetch**: Verify URLs are accessible and extract metadata
       204 +  - **AskUserQuestion**: Clarify book-level vs chapter-level preference
       205 +  
       206 +  No additional scripts, references, or assets are required for this skill.
