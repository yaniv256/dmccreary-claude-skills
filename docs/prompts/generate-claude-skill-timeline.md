# Generate a Timeline for Claude Code

!!! prompt
    Use the new timeline-generator skill to create a new timeline microsim.  Place the new 
    microsim in a directory at docs/sims/claude-code-timeline.  For the data, create 50 of 
    the most critical events that lead to the creation of Claude Code and Claude Code Skills.
    Create descriptions of these events that show when the user hovers over an event label 
    in the timeline.  When the user clicks on an event move to the ## References section of 
    the index.md file.  Events to include: Alexnet, GPT, Transformers Paper, Bert Paper, 
    GPT-2, GPT-3 Paper, ChatGPT Launch, Anthropic Founded, Claude Launched, Claude Code 
    Launched, Claude Skills Launched, This Skill Developed.  Prefer to create links in the 
    References section in the format markdown list 1. [Title](URL) - pub_date - pub_name - 
    description and relevancy to the timeline. 

## Response

Claude Code v2.0.36
Sonnet 4.5 · Claude Pro

⏺ I'll create a comprehensive timeline MicroSim showing the key events leading to Claude
  Code and Claude Skills. Let me start by planning this task and then using the
  timeline-generator skill.

> how many tokens were preset? 

⏺ Based on the token usage information from the conversation, 22,273 tokens were preset
  at the start (this includes the system prompts, skill documentation, project context
  from CLAUDE.md, and other initial context).

  By the end of creating the timeline MicroSim, we used 57,739 tokens total out of the
  200,000 token budget, meaning:
  - Preset context: 22,273 tokens (~11% of budget)
  - Conversation usage: 35,466 tokens (18% of budget)
  - Remaining: 142,261 tokens (~71% of budget)

  The preset tokens included:
  - System instructions and tool definitions
  - The timeline-generator skill documentation (~4KB)
  - Project CLAUDE.md instructions
  - Git status and repository context
  - Available skills list
