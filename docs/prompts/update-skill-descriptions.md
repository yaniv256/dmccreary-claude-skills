       117 +  
       118 +  To use these skills with Claude Code:
       119 +  
       120 +  1. Install skills globally or per-project using 
           + `/scripts/install-claude-skills.sh`
       121 +  2. View available skills with `/skills` command
       122 +  3. Invoke skills by name when working on educational content
       123 +  4. Skills coordinate automatically - e.g., glossary-generator creates 
           + definitions that venn-diagram-generator uses

         1    # Book Chapter Generator
         2    
         3 -  This skill generates the chapter structures for the book.
         3 +  ## Overview
         4    
         5 -  It will create the /docs/chapters directory and create a new directory 
           - within that for each chapter.
         6 -  It will then create an index.md file with the, title, summary and key 
           - concepts within each chapter.
         5 +  The book-chapter-generator skill generates optimal chapter structures 
           + for intelligent textbooks by analyzing course descriptions, learning 
           + graphs, and concept dependencies to distribute content evenly across 6-20
           +  chapters while respecting prerequisite relationships.
         6    
         7 +  ## Purpose
         8 +  
         9 +  This skill automates the design of chapter organization for educational 
           + textbooks, ensuring logical progression from foundational to advanced 
           + concepts based on the learning graph's directed acyclic graph (DAG) 
           + structure.
        10 +  
        11 +  ## Key Features
        12 +  
        13 +  - **Prerequisite-Based Organization**: Chapters follow concept 
           + dependencies from the learning graph
        14 +  - **Even Distribution**: Balances content across 6-20 chapters 
           + (typically 10-15 for most courses)
        15 +  - **Taxonomy Integration**: Uses concept categories to group related 
           + topics
        16 +  - **Chapter Structure**: Creates `/docs/chapters/` directory with 
           + numbered subdirectories
        17 +  - **Chapter Metadata**: Generates index.md for each chapter with title, 
           + summary, and concept list
        18 +  
        19 +  ## When to Use
        20 +  
        21 +  Use this skill after:
        22 +  - Learning graph has been generated (learning-graph.json exists)
        23 +  - Course description is finalized
        24 +  - Concept taxonomy has been established
        25 +  - Before generating chapter content
        26 +  
        27 +  ## Workflow Steps
        28 +  
        29 +  ### Step 1: Analyze Learning Graph
        30 +  Reads the learning graph to understand:
        31 +  - Total number of concepts (~200)
        32 +  - Concept dependencies (DAG structure)
        33 +  - Foundational vs advanced concepts
        34 +  - Concept categories from taxonomy
        35 +  
        36 +  ### Step 2: Determine Chapter Count
        37 +  Calculates optimal number of chapters based on:
        38 +  - Total concepts (aim for 10-20 concepts per chapter)
        39 +  - Course level (junior-high: 6-10, high school: 10-15, college: 12-18, 
           + graduate: 15-20)
        40 +  - Natural topic boundaries
        41 +  - User preferences
        42 +  
        43 +  ### Step 3: Group Concepts into Chapters
        44 +  Organizes concepts following these principles:
        45 +  - **Respect Dependencies**: Prerequisites must come before dependent 
           + concepts
        46 +  - **Logical Grouping**: Related concepts (same taxonomy category) 
           + grouped together
        47 +  - **Progressive Difficulty**: Foundational concepts early, advanced 
           + concepts later
        48 +  - **Balanced Distribution**: Roughly equal concepts per chapter
        49 +  
        50 +  ### Step 4: Create Chapter Directory Structure
        51 +  Generates folder hierarchy:
        52 +  ```
        53 +  docs/chapters/
        54 +  ├── index.md                    # Table of contents
        55 +  ├── 01-introduction/
        56 +  │   └── index.md               # Chapter 1 metadata
        57 +  ├── 02-foundational-concepts/
        58 +  │   └── index.md               # Chapter 2 metadata
        59 +  ├── 03-core-principles/
        60 +  │   └── index.md               # Chapter 3 metadata
        61 +  └── ...
        62 +  ```
        63 +  
        64 +  ### Step 5: Generate Chapter Index Files
        65 +  Creates index.md for each chapter containing:
        66 +  - **Title**: Descriptive chapter title (Title Case)
        67 +  - **Summary**: 2-3 sentence overview of chapter content
        68 +  - **Concept List**: Numbered list of concepts covered (from learning 
           + graph)
        69 +  - **Prerequisites**: Required prior knowledge
        70 +  - **Learning Objectives**: What students will learn
        71 +  
        72 +  ### Step 6: Create Table of Contents
        73 +  Generates `/docs/chapters/index.md` with:
        74 +  - Overview of the textbook structure
        75 +  - Numbered list of all chapters with summaries
        76 +  - Concept count per chapter
        77 +  - Estimated reading time
        78 +  
        79 +  ### Step 7: Update MkDocs Navigation
        80 +  Adds chapter structure to mkdocs.yml:
        81 +  ```yaml
        82 +  nav:
        83 +    - Chapters:
        84 +        - Overview: chapters/index.md
        85 +        - 1. Introduction: chapters/01-introduction/index.md
        86 +        - 2. Foundational Concepts: 
           + chapters/02-foundational-concepts/index.md
        87 +        - ...
        88 +  ```
        89 +  
        90 +  ## Chapter Organization Patterns
        91 +  
        92 +  ### Introductory Chapter (Chapter 1)
        93 +  - Welcome and motivation
        94 +  - Course overview
        95 +  - Prerequisites review
        96 +  - Key terminology introduction
        97 +  - Roadmap for learning
        98 +  
        99 +  ### Foundational Chapters (2-4)
       100 +  - Basic concepts with zero or few dependencies
       101 +  - Core vocabulary
       102 +  - Fundamental principles
       103 +  - Simple examples
       104 +  
       105 +  ### Intermediate Chapters (5-10)
       106 +  - Building on foundations
       107 +  - Integration of concepts
       108 +  - Real-world applications
       109 +  - More complex examples
       110 +  
       111 +  ### Advanced Chapters (11+)
       112 +  - High-dependency concepts
       113 +  - Synthesis and integration
       114 +  - Advanced techniques
       115 +  - Capstone project preparation
       116 +  
       117 +  ## Quality Standards
       118 +  
       119 +  A well-structured chapter organization should have:
       120 +  - Clear progression from simple to complex
       121 +  - No concept appears before its prerequisites
       122 +  - Balanced chapter sizes (10-20 concepts each)
       123 +  - Logical topic groupings
       124 +  - Clear chapter titles that indicate content
       125 +  - Comprehensive coverage of all learning graph concepts
       126 +  
       127 +  ## Output Files
       128 +  
       129 +  1. `/docs/chapters/index.md`: Table of contents
       130 +  2. `/docs/chapters/NN-chapter-name/index.md`: Chapter metadata files
       131 +  3. Updated `mkdocs.yml`: Navigation structure
       132 +  
       133 +  ## Integration
       134 +  
       135 +  This skill coordinates with:
       136 +  - **learning-graph-generator**: Uses the DAG structure and concept list
       137 +  - **chapter-content-generator**: Provides structure for content 
           + generation
       138 +  - **glossary-generator**: Concepts align with glossary terms
       139 +  - **quiz-generator**: Each chapter gets assessment aligned with concepts
       140 +  
       141 +  ## Best Practices
       142 +  
       143 +  1. **Chapter Size**: Aim for 10-20 concepts per chapter (adjust for 
           + complexity)
       144 +  2. **Naming**: Use descriptive, parallel chapter titles (all nouns or 
           + all gerunds)
       145 +  3. **Dependencies**: Always verify prerequisites are in earlier chapters
       146 +  4. **Taxonomy**: Group related taxonomy categories together when 
           + possible
       147 +  5. **Balance**: Avoid one very short or very long chapter
       148 +  6. **Preview**: Show what's coming in chapter summaries
       149 +  7. **Review**: Reference earlier concepts when introducing new ones
       150 +  
       151 +  ## Example Chapter Structure
       152 +  
       153 +  For a 200-concept course on Machine Learning:
